The variable on the left-hand side of a tilde (~) is called the "dependent variable", while the variables on the right-hand side are called the "independent variables" and are joined by plus signs +

general-purpose tools that allow you to capture the values of variables without evaluating them so that they can be interpreted by the function

the sepal width is a function of petal width, conditioned on species
Sepal.Width ~ Petal.Width | Species

In addition to the + symbol, there are also other symbols that can add special meaning to your formulas:
- for removing terms;
: for interaction;
* for crossing;
%in% for nesting; And
^ for limit crossing to the specified degree.
. operator -- you refer to all other variables in the matrix that haven't yet been included in the model


y ~ x1 * x2 == y ~ x1 + x2 + x1:x2

y ~ a + a:b
y ~ a + b %in% a

y ~ x + I(x^2); I() "as-is" operator
