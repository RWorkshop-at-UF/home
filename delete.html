  <h4>Workshop description:</h4>
  <p>The workshop introduces the R programming language to a novice programmer; the workshop expects no prior programming experience. The workshop will be focusing on learning R as a general-purpose programming language and not as a statistics tool. It will NOT be covering how to run various statistical models and packages. At the end of this workshop, students are expected to re-construct data to their needs, learn the basics of obtaining online data, conduct simple text analysis, and perform a graphical display of the results.
