"1.0 out of 5 stars","Press ""hold"" then up or down; let the temp flash on LED, up r down, then it's ""held""","BILLY AND ALLEY","7-31-2016","Verified Purchase","Update-stopped working properly a few months after my review but just getting a chance to change this to one star rating. I would set it on 75 degrees then an hour later it would be set to 71 even after turning off the programming. First one worked 10 years!Old Review- Mine worked great after setting a few programmable times. I usually set it to hold anyway during the summer. Despite the neg reviews some gave, mine worked great and is still doing what I programmed it to do. If you want to hold at a center temp; as some were having problems; just make sure you press ""Hold"" (you can see the hold change on the led) then press the up or down button until the temp flashes on the LED, then it's on the temp you want it held at. I use this programmable one during the winter. 2nd one I have owned. First one lasted 10 years; practically identical to this one, same brand/buttons; just a newer version I guess.","Hunter_44157","2018-01-31","yes",NA,1
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Good quality product, easy install for inexperienced user... go for it","hendysuz","11-10-2017","Verified Purchase","Installation complete!  I am not an electrician and I don't have a man around to do these things for me (not worth it when I am pretty capable).  This was really easy, and I normally shy away from electrical work, but the instructions seemed clear on the exterior package.  The book inside was well written and concise. Had the tools, turned off the breakers and about 30 minutes later I had a functioning thermostat.  It's running now and things seem to be working well.  I'll update again if it doesn't seem to doing the job or fails.Gave it five stars, o my negative I can find is that it was so inexpensive so in the back of my head I'm anticipating failure... but everything seems to be working. Looks really nice on my wall, and quality of product is nice.  5 stars","Hunter_44157","2018-01-31","yes",NA,5
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Worth the money","Mark J Daniels","2-21-2015","Verified Purchase","The thermostats work great. I bought them for the Parrish Hall for the Church. There were 8 zones so I needed 8 units. The programing of the thermostats is very easy. The instructions are printed inside the cover. One unit did come with a bad LCD display and needed to be replaced. Amazon, as always, made sure the exchange was quick and painless.  I would have only deducted half a star but I am not allowed to. The reason for the 4 stars is as follows. 1. There is a sticker that covers the LCD screen that is really tough to remove. You really need to pull hard to get it off. I wonder if this is the reason one LCD display was not working.  2.  Included in the package are stickers that you can mark the wires going to the thermostat. The stickers had really poor adhesive on them and would not stick together at all. I had to use scotch tape to hold the stickers on. The stickers would not be a problem for a 2 wire connection but 3 of the thermostats have 5 wire connections.  3. Batteries not included.  4. There is only 2 mounting screws in the package. There should be a minimum of 3.  Overall the units are doing what I need them to do.","Hunter_44157","2018-01-31","yes",NA,4

What a bummer.

"1.0 out of 5 stars","Doesn't work correctly","Astrid","8-21-2015","Verified Purchase","We received this thermostat and within an hour or so it was clear it didn't measure the temperature correctly and it kept resetting itself. We would have it programmed to stay at 75 and after three hours it would decide to just switch to 85. After 2 days of this and setting all kinds of programs, we decided it was time to exchange it. I asked for an exchange rather than a return thinking it was just one bad unit and because it was an exact replica of our old, broken thermostat, just a different brand. The replacement arrived and this time it took about 10 hours before that unit too was defective. We call the manufacturers, thinking maybe this was operator error but they told us ""you'll need to buy a new one""Needless to say we won't be buying a new one.This is one terrible product. I'm currently processing my refund through amazon and we've since bought a completely different thermostat that works just fine.","Hunter_44157","2018-01-31","yes",NA,1

We have come to the conclusion that this is not a programmable thermostat and doesn't even work as a manual thermostat. It daily changes temperatures even when every program is set to 70 degrees.

"1.0 out of 5 stars","Poor Quality Control","GReviews","1-20-2015","Verified Purchase","We ordered two Hunter 44157 for our rental properties to replace some older manual thermostats. We intentionally looked for this brand because we've owned the Hunter 44110 (no backlight) for six+ years and have had a good experience with them. The backlight in the 44157 model seemed appealing and the advertised feature set (per the user manual) was all the same as our older ones, so we felt good about giving them a try. Below is a brief description of our experience.Ease of Installation and UseThe included installation/user manual is adequate for most skill levels, and for most normal (single stage) natural gas furnace installations the process is straightforward. We also preferred these over the ones in stock at the local hardware stores because the batteries are very easy to replace right on the front of the unit. Most models sold now a days require you to remove the unit from its wall plate to replace the batteries located inside of the thermostat; which is intimidating for most tenants.The Temperature HOLD FeatureThe printed documentation as well as the instructions on the unit itself describe the HOLD feature as a way to permanently override all programming settings, leaving the unit in ""manual' operation or vacation mode. In other words, while the HOLD icon displays on the screen, the programming will not run; the temperature you set it to will be held until you manually change it. For our needs, this feature is not only desirable but required when one of our rentals is vacant as it makes it simple to override the programming. Our older 44110 units work this way and they have been reliable so far. Not so for these 44157 model. The HOLD feature on these is erratic and cannot be trusted. As you read the different reviews and their comments for this on Amazon, you'll find people having totally opposing opinions and experiences with it even after carefully following the printed instructions.The Night-Light FeatureWe installed both of them according to the product's instructions and proceeded to setup a custom programming for the week/weekend days. The backlight comes on when any of the buttons is pressed and goes off on its own after a few seconds. Sadly, the backlight in one of them failed within the first few minutes of use. It started working fine but then it flickered a couple of times and just would not light up anymore. The other one was installed in a unit that was vacant at the time, so we setup a very specific programming for it. The backlight on this second unit would light up, but it also had a little flicker issue, and while the light was was on, you could hear a faint beep sound from inside the unit.The ProgrammingAfter about four days, we stopped at the vacant unit and inspected the programming only to find that it had very different set of times and temperatures from what we had originally set it to. Re-programmed it the way we needed it, and then ran the furnace a couple of cycles while we did some cleaning. It turns out the thermostat unit was sort of resetting itself to random temperatures ranging from 48F to 69F, all within a couple of hours time.It seems the manufacturer has lowered their quality control standards and so their products are no longer as solid as they used to be. We returned both units and replaced them with a different brand.","Hunter_44157","2018-01-31","yes",NA,1

I can take the ""hold"" off, and my program remains changed until I go back in and fix it. really annoying and not very helpful for setting for vacation. I got this to replace another Hunter model, and I liked it because it is large and covers the hole in the wall well.  But, this flaw really ruins the thermostat.

I had installed an older model at my last place and was very happy with it, never having any problems.  So despite what some others reported, I purchased this model.  Unfortunately I encountered the same problems.  If I deviated from the programmed temperatures by manually adjusting the thermostat, it affected the permanent program for that time period.  So the next day, when the program for that time period activated, the temporary setting was the one used.  It did not matter if I used the permanent override or not, the changes always affected the programming even though I was not in programming mode.  I ended up sending it back and purchasing a Honeywell.  For those that want to simply program and never change anything on a temporary basis, the Hunter would be fine.

I tried it for a few days but no matter how we set it, it kept doing its own thing and changing the temperature.  My son is very mechanically inclined, so when he couldn't get it to work properly, I knew it was either defective or a really bad product.  I ended up returning this thermostat and ordering PRO1 IAQ T701 (non-programmable) instead.  The PRO model is excellent!  It works perfectly, and I now have the blue backlight that I wanted.","Hunter_44157","2018-01-31","yes",NA,1

Not only does it have 4 time periods per day, and separate settings for weekends, but it has a settable ""span,"" to determine how many degrees to go below and above the set temperature before switching on or off. A wider span can avoid cycling your furnace or pellet stove too fast. Other thermostats this price lack that feature. It also can be set to ramp between settings, rather than suddenly change them at the set times.Definitely requires reading the manual. The controls will not make sense without it.

I'm not sure if the quality itself has diminished since my original was manufactured, but I had to return this new one for a refund.  I programmed this thermostat exactly as I had programmed the original and the first problem that I had was that the new unit would intermittently jump away from the program.  It was programmed to keep the heat temp set at 66F during the overnight hours and three times in two weeks we woke up to temps of 55F and 58F???  That alone was enough for me, but that wasn't the end of it.  My old unit worked great for 10+ years, but the temp up/down buttons began to not work and that was the reason for the replacement.  I ordered a LUXPRO unit to try.  The first thing I noticed was the my original Hunter and the new LUX registered the same temp, while the new Hunter that I have since returned, was registering 3F higher than both of the others.  Obviously, I was happy with the service of the first Hunter unit, but for some reason, the new unit did not meet the high operating standards that I had enjoyed for the last ten years.","Hunter_44157","2018-01-31","yes",NA,1

I told them, I would rather avoid giving a bad review and all the hassle with a return. They offered no help. The seller offered to refund the product, upon return. I decided to set everything down by 4 degrees, and it works fine, unless a family member changes it back to standard setpoint.

We would go to bed with the setting and temperature at 70, and wake up at 4 in the morning with the setting at 60, and the house temp dropped to 63 or lower.

Believe that these are tested before they ship. It was easy to install (replaced a round honeywell) and seems to function very good. The Lux website provided me with a programming manual so that was not a problem. I'm giving it a four star because the hinge on cover plate needs to be redesigned (alignment problem), makes it tricky to close unless you have the hinge in the right position.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","It's nice and appears to work and comes at a decent ...","Anubis","7-14-2014","Pattern: 7-Day|Verified Purchase","I've been wanting my own programmable thermostat for years now, but apartment living has been a damper to that ... so this is the first unit I've owned.  It's nice and appears to work and comes at a decent price, but it's not that user friendly.Installation was fairly easy.  As a new home owner, my opinion on this may be somewhat tainted in that I haven't done a lot of around-the-house labor to have a good scale of difficulty built up, but then again, if I can do it, it's probably pretty simple.  I have VERY limited electrical wiring experience, but the instructions are clear enough in this regard to walk you through it.  And they include 6 diagrams for the 6 most common home HVAC wiring schemes, with each of those including possible variations on wire labels.  My biggest complaint here is that the included paper instruction manual is basically a single large sheet of paper that is somewhat confusing and extremely simplistic.  The included manual does make it clear that the full manual is available online as a PDF, but the problem is that they tried to include both the installation and the operation instructions on the one sheet of paper ... if you're going to omit material and tell someone to go to the website to read the whole thing, at least include all of the INSTALLATION instructions.  Along with that, there wasn't much help in trying to sort out what type of system your house might have (if say, you've only lived there a month).Operation is a little more wonky.  My complaints here are not about functionality ... in fact, this programmable thermostat has quite a few features for something so reasonably priced.  I actually didn't expect things like ""smart recovery"" (where it learns how long it takes the HVAC to reach the desire temperature, then starts it up BEFORE the desired time so that the desired temperature is reached ahead of time) or filter reminders.  The problem is that the actual user interface and the methods by which you interact with the thermostat are not intuitive or friendly.  The basics are obvious enough, but for things like accessing display features or system running customization, it becomes something of a chore that will require you to check the manual.  For example, just to change something like temperature display (Fahrenheit or Celcius), you have to set the HEAT / COOL switch to off, then hold NEXT for 5 seconds, which pops up a series of VERY simply worded phrases that amount to a number and a short-hand, and you have to scroll through these from beginning to end, with no jumping forward or backward option.  This is the case for most of the program features.  One lucky break: the thermostat includes a COPY feature, which lets you copy an entire day's worth of programed temperatures and times to another day.  Without this, it would take you a good 10 minutes or more just to program the 4 periods of the 7 days.So while I highly recommend this thermostat for the reasonable price and various programmable features, along with the 7 day format, be aware that it is not easy to interact with, and you'll probably need to consult the manual anytime you need to change something other than the current temperature.-- EDIT: As a quick pointer, I notice that this thermostat, or maybe it's just thermostats in general, does not like rechargeable batteries.  It seems there is some kind of voltage problem, as it shows as full for about a week or so, then suddenly the battery is dead.  However, when I use standard one-use AA batteries, it works fine ... and in fact, I haven't replaced the batteries for well over a month now. --","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","yes",7,4

I have noticed a good $20-$30 drop in my electric bills based on the past. I have it programmed to change temperature after I leave for work, and right before I get home, and also to cool off overnight. The weekend has a different schedule as well. It is really nice to not have to deal with the temperature settings for vacation as well. It will hold a set temperature for several days while I am away, and click back on before I arrive; nice. The filter and battery monitor is nice as well.I have not noticed any problems with this thermostat. It was really easy to set up as well.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","yes",5,3

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Work well but have minor annoyances","Stephen","12-30-2015","Pattern: 7-Day|Verified Purchase","I replaced all the thermostats in my house with these.  They work well and I don't know of another product that would be better.  It is especially good that: - They work with a variety of heating systems.  I have some zones with air conditioning and some without.  The same thermostat can be used with either. - They have settings for four time periods or just two time periods.  I have a zone where nobody sleeps where I have just a day and night schedule.  Other zones have the full wake, leave, return, sleep schedules. - There are separate schedules for each day of the week. - There is a copy feature to program the same schedule onto multiple days so that you don't have to press so many buttons programmingI'm not giving it five stars because there are some annoyances: - The back light makes a high pitched hum noise while it is on - I wish the only buttons on the front were temperature up and down.  The hold, and ""set back"" buttons should be hidden under the cover. - The ""set back"" feature is very hard to use.  You have to hold down the button, adjust the set back temperature, and choose a duration.  It is difficult enough to use that I wish it were not even included. - There are multiple hidden menus.  The hidden menu for calibration is different than the hidden menu for turning on and off features.  The manual says which button combinations you have to hold down to get to the different hidden menus.  It would be nice to have a single hidden menu. - I had to calibrate mine.  When they came they were not well calibrated.  I put multiple of them next to each other gave them an hour.  After that time they disagreed by three degrees.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","yes",7,4

"5.0 out of 5 stars","99% Perfect!","Whisper","12-25-2014","Pattern: 7-Day|Verified Purchase","TX9100Ua and TX9100Uc (This First review was in Early 2015 I think)This economical unit is Excellent and a Real Bargain to boot. It has every feature we needed- is inexpensive, easy to program, easy to use, has a good downloadable instruction manual, first rate build quality and has a responsive US based technical  help line that really does help!We are refitting our old Church steam heating system with Programmable thermostats and wanted units without the ""Hold"" feature. For a home the Hold is very desirable, but for a multi-building institution  which is used by many different people we didn't want someone to set the Temperature up to 74- press Hold and forget to reset it- thus heating the unoccupied space for days or weeks. We couldnt find one- but we were able to modify this unit to suit our needs.The 4 front buttons are a resilient semisoft plastic that push through to the membrane switches mounted on the circuit board. You can remove the 8 small screws holding the circuit board to access this strip of soft buttons.  Then a neat razor trim of the Hold and Setback buttons can set them back below their front panel openings. Scraping off the Front label leaves no trace. But the hold and setback features are still  available if needed  by pressing the newly indented buttons from the front with a small screwdriver.We bought 3 of these from Lowes and 1 from Amazon- same model number but they were not the same.The Lowes units had a number ending with ""a"" and the Amazon unit ended with ""c"" but the packages didnt show that difference- and it is significant. The ""a"" unit has a ""Duration"" setting (60, 30, 20, 10 etc) which sets the time in minutes between the cycles. One unexpected behavior with the duration type is that the unit comes on at the preset duration time even if the thermostat is satisfied- then it turns off after a brief ""ON"" period. For most applications this would  be OK but it wasn't ideal for our system which uses large motor valves which dont like to be turned on and off quickly.  The ""c"" unit uses a ""Swing"" number from 1 to 9. The Swing is the +or - temperature between on and off- and each numeral is equal to one quarter degree F. So if you want your heating to come on at 69 and go off at 71 then set the Swing to 4- setting it to 8 would give 68 to 72.  Both ""a"" and ""c"" units have a maximum load rating of 1.5amps per terminal and 3.0amps total Maximum load.For us, this meant using a control relay to supply the 1.8amps our motor valves need. (this relay is not needed for normal home use - and it is certainly not a defect in the Thermostat)There are 4 temperature changes per day allowed- LUX labels them Morn, Day, Evening and Night but they canbe any time but must be at least 15 minutes apart. Thus 4 to 4:15AM , 4:45 to 5:15AM and  8 to 8:45PM and 9 to 11PM would work.Things we like-Presettable max or min temperature that limits the Temp the front Arrow buttons can reach (we set ours to 74)Special program feature- which you can set for your system to go to another daily program for 1 to 30 days-IE Vacation.Lockable settings to prevent anyone changing the program or settings unless they know the 4 digit code.Something we wish- that there was a way to lock the program (as well as the Hold and Reset buttons) but  leave the UP/ DOWN arrows available for temporary temperature adjustments by the occupants . Having that change would make this unit 100% PERFECT!PS: We can hear no ""buzz"" with any of our 4 units.Update-  October 2017- we now have 8 of these T'Stats and still are happy with them overall- but have just encountered a problem where one of the first installed units lost its time and day setting. We ordered a replacement .for it and found that the battery holder which previously depended on spring tension to maintain contact is now soldered to the circuit board. Experimenting with another early unit found we could make it lose its time and day setting by slightly twisting the circuit board. We believe that LUX discovered this weakness sometime back and made the appropriate design change to correct it. Our fix was to make the same easy repair to each of our old units (you have to clip off the small white plastic bridge on each end of the battery holder and then carefully solder the silver contact down to the circuit board using rosin core solder of course).Units purchased currently probably do not need this fix.  Hope this helps someone with misbehaving older units.I still give them 5 stars for all the reasons mentioned above- plus this new evidence of ongoing attention to a quality problem. Good job LUX!","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","yes",7,5

"2.0 out of 5 stars","This thermostat has a mind of its own.","JS","7-14-2014","Pattern: 5-2 Day|Verified Purchase","This thermostat has a mind of its own.  My a/c comes on when the room temperature is well below the set temperature, it comes on sometimes for just a few seconds, and other times it doesn't come on at all.  There is something called the system cycle duration which supposedly limits the number of times per hour the a/c will turn on.  I have it set to 20, which means 3x hour.  So the a/c turns on 3x hour even when it the room temp is below the set temp, e.g. room temp is 75 and set temp is 78.  It should not cycle on at that point, but it does.I am very dissatisfied with this unit.  There is no swing setting either which seems like such a basic feature, i.e. it lets you set how many degrees below and above the set temp you want which is great because it prevents the a/c from constantly turning on to maintain a single setting.A small thing, but the cover which you must open to change the program is very flimsy and difficult to remove.The install went very well.I'm in the process of working with tech support, but so far their advice has not been helpful.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","yes",3,2

"5.0 out of 5 stars","The Uc model is the one you want.","HBP","6-4-2015","Pattern: 5-1-1 Day|Verified Purchase","There are at least 4 different editions of this thermostat.  The TX1500U, Ua, Ub, and Uc.  I have owned a Ua and Ub.  These two variations do not use the classic temperature swing control method but rather provide a ""cycles per hour"" technique.  I considered the Ua model very wasteful and hard on the compressor as it cycles the unit in both heat and cool mode the specified number of times an hour whether the temperature is out of range or not.  Sometimes the compressor would cut on and run less than a minute.  The Ub was better as it at least ran the compressor a few minutes each time but still the starts and stops were ridiculous.  In its latest rendition, the Uc, Lux appears to have come to their senses and gone back to the tried and true temperature swing method.  The user can set the swing as desired (I like +- 0.5 degrees) and the thermostat only operates the compressor when it is needed.  The TX1500Uc is a great thermostat.  I like it much better than any of the ""cycle rate"" models from Lux or Honeywell.  Hopefully Amazon is only shipping the Uc models of these Lux thermostats.  In my opinion they are definitely the one you want.---I must add that Lux customer support has been excellent.  Within my 3 year warranty period they shipped me a Ub unit to replace the Ua.  They have now replaced the Ub unit with a Uc model.  In both cases it cost me nothing as a prepaid return envelope was included.

Bought this one based on the good decent reviews and good looks. I really should have researched this more. If you dismiss my review, because of all the other good ones on here, really consider buying the backplate accessory. This was quite a bit smaller than my old one and now I have ugly holes in my wall that I need to patch and paint over.I've replaced thermostats on the past and have never had this much trouble with initial setup. First the hookup was a pain and the instructions weren't really clear. This was somewhat understandable since my old one was from a different manufacturer and it made sense that not everything would match. Programming it was a pain. Some of the steps and codes were clear and others still baffle me. I wasn't 100% sure what all of the different options are but maybe they're for a different type of unit. Programming was such a chore, that I still have it in manual set mode to this day.That would be OK and I'd keep it. But I'm having one problem ever since I set it up. My AC sounds like a revving race car when it turns on. Seems to work fine after that but it worries me. Thank God I have a home warranty in-case it dies.This alone would make me return it but my return period on Amazon ended last weekend so I guess it will go back in the box until I find someone on Craigslist to resell this to.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","yes",3,1

I subtracted one star for a few convenience issues:1. It seems to take a lot of force to detach the front panel; I was afraid I would break the tabs. Of course, it isn't necessary to do this very often, but it should not be difficult.2. The printed instructions in the package are adequate to get started, but why not just provide the full printed guide instead of making the user access the 32 page pdf online?3. I would prefer to be able to specify the temp swing in degrees and I thought the ""500Uc"" model that I received had this feature, but it is still the 1-9 scale others have noted. Again, not a huge deal (the ""4"" setting seems to work for me), but I wish Lux and/or Amazon would clear up the labeling.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","yes",3,4

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Most features didn't seem to work","KevinF","1-10-2014","Pattern: 5-1-1 Day|Verified Purchase","I purchased this to replace a manual model thinking that programmable was the way to go.  It installed in a few minutes, but immediately I noticed it didn't work as I expected.  I could not get the override function or the hold function to work correctly.  Perhaps I just got a lemon.  I called Lux support but had to leave a message for a call back.  They did call back (about 8 hours later) but by that time I had given up on this and put my old thermostat back on.  I ended up sending this unit back and got an exact replacement for my existing thermostat (the one I had would was acting up, hence the need to replace it).Other thoughts on the Lux thermostat: the door is pretty flimsy and I thought that it might not last very long before a hinge let go.  Programming is fairly easy and overall this may have been a good unit if the other features worked as described.  It was strange that it would call for heat, turn on the furnace, then after about 45 seconds shut the furnace back down - particularly when trying to use the override feature (temp was set to 65, wanted to override to 68, furnace would run for 45 seconds and then everything went back to program settings).  I never did talk to Lux, but I suspect they would have replace the unit.  The manual thermostat I exchanged this for works perfectly - and I don't mind having to set the temp myself (It's an Honeywell Digital Dial thermostat).Based on my experience with this particular thermostat I cannot recommend it.UPDATE June 30, 2014.  Lux sent me a replacement unit that is reported to fix the quick cycle issue.  The installation of the replacement thermostat was a snap (took less than five minutes) and programming is quite simple.  I am currently only using the standard run cycle for cooling with a ""hold"" setting for the A/C.  It appears to be cycling the A/C normally and it has been doing a good job of holding the temp at the set value.  Since the thermostat is in the hallway, I'm not surprised that the temperature is showing slightly higher in other rooms (with many windows), so I've set the temp accordingly to compensate for that.The revised unit looks just like the other one, and still has the somewhat questionable (flimsy) front panel door.  The hinge on the door makes be a bit nervous - and I think that it could be easily damaged.  Knowing that, I'm careful when opening it.  Of course if the program cycles work as expected, there would be little reason to even open the front panel door.The real test will come in the winter when I run it using a heating cycle.  I will update my review then once I've had a chance to see how it works, particularly the override and the hold functions - along with the cycling times.For now, I'm going to keep this at two stars.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","yes",5,2

However about 3 days ago it stopped showing them, it just shows a solid ""LO"". As the instructions say that it may damage my AC equipment when this happens, I was forced to buy another one, but this time I bought the TX1500-E, the older model, as I have one of those on my 2nd floor and it has been working fine for over 4 years now.I have been working in the computer industry since 1971, and cannot fathom why a thermostat would require a specific brand of batteries, and why it would go bananas like this one ...","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","yes",5,1

Our pellet stove continues to run after the thermostat has clicked it off because it has to finish burning the rest of the pellets and then it takes another 20 minutes or more to push all the hot air out of the stove and into the room.  Because of this feature, we program the thermostat to shut off at 70 degrees, knowing that by the time the pellet stove actually ""completely"" shuts down if will be 72 degrees in the home.  Likewise, we want it to not turn on again until its at 68 degrees.  We explained this all to AMazon who did let us return the thermostat but we were charged a heavy price for shipping (even though it was prime) to return the item.

I quickly began to remove the old unit, and followed the advise from the manual to label each wire prior to disconnecting it from the thermostat (not necessary, but I wanted to avoid confusion if I had an issue).And then it happened. I scanned the wiring diagrams, and none of them lined up to the 8 wire setup on my thermostat. Fortunately, I had read other reviews, and used that wisdom to go to the Lux website to download a more complete set of wiring schematics. Hooray for good online support! In minutes, I learned that the T (tan) and B (blue) wires are not used for this thermostat, clipped them and taped them off, and finished the installation.Now I'm a happy guy! The new thermostat kicked in right away, and the temperature reading is actually accurate. I tested that the heat, a/c, and emergency heat all worked as needed. Then I used the feature loaded box to adjust the cycle times, temperature variation, emergency heat threshold, and temperature settings for my personal preferences. And, it is attractive, too!!!**Update** Still working flawlessly. Because the new thermostats keep the temperature regulated better, we are far more comfortable.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","yes",3,5

The Lux website clearly states that the TX9100U supports the swing feature.The order and packaging clearly states that I ordered and received the TX9100U, however after opening the thermostat I noticed the directions and model number printed on the thermostat are clearly the TX9100Ua. The problem is that Lux removed the swing feature from this model.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","SFSG, with small caveat","KatKit103","1-28-2016","Pattern: 5-2 Day|Verified Purchase","I was looking for an inexpensive replacement thermostat with a true temperature swing setting, since with the old one our heat pump was cycling too frequently for optimal efficiency and longevity. This seems like an answer. Other than it's tweakability, it is relatively basic (don't really need seven day programming or a touchscreen) but it gets the job done. Installation took a little longer due to the different design and terminal layout, but I certainly didn't need a service call from someone looking to install a premium model.It was a little hard to separate from the base. Good that I only need batteries as backup, so decent ones should last awhile. And although it will briefly drift +/- a degree from the setpoint (due partly to my +/- 0.5 swing), so far operation is smooth. A 'possible' flaw in really cold weather is the auxiliary heat control: An adjustable offset that prevents AUX until the temperature is X degrees below the setpoint. Good if you want to manually bump the temperature slightly without using more expensive AUX. Maybe not so good if the heat pump alone can't maintain the setpoint, and room temp drops 2+ degrees before supplemental heat engages. That should be rare around here, and occasional adjustment shouldn't be bothersome. Speaking of minimizing AUX, enabling ""smart recovery""/""early recovery"" is wise when using a setback (which should also be modest for a standard heat pump) unless it's smaller than the offset.I do wonder if the sensor is a bit slow, as it takes time for it to re-equilibrate with room temperature after the backlight circuit warms it up. The switches are somewhat small and cheapish feeling compared to my old stat. The access door is also on the thin side (it'd likely take a mm more plastic for a more solid unit), and the double hinge makes it slightly awkward to shut if you let it fall below a ~90 degree angle. Perhaps not ideal for families that frequently adjust their stat, but we don't mess with it much. So if we get several years out of this and it doesn't screw up, I'll be happy. To me, it's better than paying more for the 'other' brand that is less adjustable and only has a 1 year warranty in it's consumer line.As a semi-contientous Amazonian, I will try to edit my review if something really unsatisfactory arises.Update:  So went through a summer, and another winter. It would be nice if a swing could be set separately for cool and heat mode. Or ideally, it would be nice to find a t-stat that can properly adjust cycle times even in less than perfect installations. Heat isn't always evenly distributed, and some days waiting for a full +/- 0.5/1 degree total swing can leave floors and ductwork a bit chilly (maybe a house issue). Conversely, during the cooling season a wider swing can be better for efficiency and dehumidification.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","yes",3,3

I took the specifications at face value. I simply wanted to be able to adjust the ""temperature swing"" ie, how much the temperature had to come up before it turned off the heat request. Most thermostats have a very narrow setting, something like .1 degree F(or less) With my system the heater would cycle every 8 minutes. I wanted .5 degree F. The TX500U literature states the ""temperature swing"" use user defined from .25 to 2.00 F. What is TRUE is that this is the case ONLY if you have a Heat Pump as a primary source and a Electric/gas source as a secondary. My system is single gas fired only.UPDATE as of May 7, 2014. Lux Products worked with me and solved my problem by supplying a model TX9600TS unit. It works very well.The original problem was that I purchased a model TX500U. the supplier did not have that unit but shipped me a TX500Ua, notice the lowercase a . I assume that the shipper does not know that there is difference between the ""Ua"" and the ""U"" . The Ua does not have a swing setting that I wanted.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Great Thermostat","Southplank","12-8-2017","Pattern: 7-Day|Verified Purchase","I'm happy with this thermostat. It works well and is easy to see without my reading glasses. Amazon price was half of my local home center price. I don't know if its my imagination or what, but the room temperature seems more steady. It could very well be, our old digital thermostat was 25 years old. While I found installation easy and straight forward, I would say this is not a project for the the average do-it-yourselfer, especially if you have heat+AC wiring and are electrically challenged. The problem for some may be that the labeling and wire colors on your old thermostat terminals may not match the new one. It helps to understand how thermostat systems work so you can be sure you are connecting it correctly. If you are not sure if you can do this, download the instruction manual from Lux and open up your old thermostat. If the installation wiring charts make sense and you are certain you identified all of your wires correctly, go ahead and buy this and install it yourself.This is a small challenge to program, you need to read the instructions carefully. If you figured out the wiring, you can certainly get through the programming. Once you 'get it', its not that bad. There is a copy function to copy one day to another to speed things up. Keep the instructions handy because you won't remember how to reprogram it when you need to change the program. Speaking of instructions, it comes with a sheet, but you can download the full 30+ page manual.Some reviewers mentioned pulling the whole unit off the wall when opening the front panel. They are certainly putting their finger in the wrong spot. The design of the plastic housing does make it confusing the first time, but once you see the correct way, opening the front panel is effortless.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","yes",7,5

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Failed during the warranty, but got a replacement","gWiz","10-10-2017","Pattern: 5-2 Day","I originally bought this thermostat over other thermostats because it looked like nice and simple and promised easy programming.  It turned out to be easy to set up and program.  It has a nice backlit display with the temperature in a larger readable size.  After about two years, I got the low battery indicator and replaced the batteries.The low battery indicator didn't go away. I tried hardware reset, cleaning the contacts, checking the battery voltage  and got the same low battery indicator.  I then figured that the thermostat had just gone bad and I had nothing to loose, so I removed the screws on the PC board and looked at the other sided for a bad component, particularly a bad capacitor.  I didn't find it at first, but then I found something that looked like a tiny battery that had tiny specs of blue corrosion on it.In my online searches, I came across the fact that this thermostat has a 3 year warranty, so I called the Lux techline.  I told them what the problem was and what I saw and they sent me a new thermostat.  I am happy again.With the new thermostat in place and working, I looked at the faulty thermostat with the low battery indicator and removed the bad tiny battery and found out that it is actually a capacitor that saves the memory when changing the regular AA batteries.  I found the part number for the capacitor, (it is a SM 3R3 703, 70mF, 3.3volts) and planned on ordering it.  Just to keep things together while I waited for the order to get placed and the part to come in, I put the thermostat back together with the AA batteries.  The display now gave me a full battery indication.  So, perhaps, just removing this tiny battery/capacitor will allow it to get around the problem.I will install the capacitor so that the program can be saved when changing the batteries or when handling the thermostat and the AA batteries get jostled.It was disappointing that the capacitor/battery failed so soon, however, getting a replacement under warranty softened the disappointment and now finding a work around will allow me to replace my upstairs thermostat, so that we have the same easy to program thermostat both upstairs and downstairs.My expectation is that Lux has already (or will soon) recognized that the capacitor is failing early and correct it.  Based on this experience, I would recommend it.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","no",3,4

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Lots of efficiency settings for heatpumps","whatever","2-25-2016","Pattern: 5-2 Day|Verified Purchase","Only a few days but the heat pump no longer goes to aux/emergency heat regularly or cycles every couple minutes like the honeywells these replaced.  These allow a swing selection of 1 to 9 degrees or so before the unit will kick on. So instead of the unit cycling back on like the honeywell when the temp drops 1/2 degree which is just minutes in extremely cold weather you can set it to let it drop a couple degree first.  Longer cycles for efficiency. Also allows you to set a number of degrees before aux/emergency kicks in. For example if you can set that function to 5 degrees the aux heat won't kick in unless there is a 5 degree or more gap between set temp and current, even then if it's programmed it will anticipate and start early. That setting saves money by anticipating the temp required in the AM for example and starts early so it reaches the temp without kicking on the aux heat. Aux will still kick in if primary stage can't maintain set temp and drops below your programmed kick in gap. I'm sure I didn't use the proper terms but I wish I'd research before I got the honeywells. They killed my electric bill with aux heat and short cycles before I finally realized they were the problem.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","yes",3,5
"1.0 out of 5 stars","DO NOT BUT THIS THERMOSTAT!!!","C. J. Myers","11-11-2015","Pattern: 5-1-1 Day|Verified Purchase","Purchased this to replace a Honeywell nonprogramable stat. This works on heat pumps. It has 4 different temperature timings per day & I love the adjustable dead band (swing temperature - change in sensed temperature to turn heat/air on & off). Many new thermostats have a fixed dead band of 1 Deg F (cooling on 0.5 Deg F above set point & cooling off 0.5 Deg F below set point). They do this in an effort to maintain a more uniform & constant temperature, but it causes your unit to run more often & for shorter time periods. It's easy to program with the enclosed paperwork & it is easy to temporarily override programmed temperature. The backlit display works well & the filter monitor is a good reminder to change the filter (and the filter monitor hour setting is also adjustable). The display shows temperature, temperature set point, heat or cool mode, filter life remaining, time, day of week and programmed time mode (morn, day, eve, night). It has early recovery feature & battery backup. It does not automatically change between heat & cool...must be done manually with a switch, but that is what I wanted.UPDATE:  Although this thermostat has a lot of nice features, DO NOT BUT IT!!!!  The thermostat went bad after 2 years (Thermostat showed batteries were dead even with new alkaline batteries). Contacted company and they were very polite and helpful. The sent me a new thermostat for free, and I had to ship the defective thermostat back. They said that they were mailing me a new thermostat, but they would not do this again.

The reason I?™ve bought so many is because, unfortunately, I keep moving and I don?™t have the nerve to take the thermostat with me. The reason I initially bought this one is to save money on heating. I lived in Ohio and now Colorado and it makes all the sense in the world to have the temperature set lower at night and it?™s a pain to set it every day. What I do with the Lux is set the thermostat to heat up about half an hour before I get out of bed and then go down after I generally go to work again and then up again prior to returning home. That way the temperature is always comfortable without keeping the heat on all day. I?™ll let others debate whether having the temperature go up and down four times a day actually saves on heating bills but I?™m not talking huge temperature swings.The one nagging annoyance is when my routine is broken. If, for instance, I take a week off I now need to reset five days and that can take some time. It would also be nice if you could change more than one day at a time. During the work week all the four daily temperature changes are the same time and same temperature but I have to go through each day one at a time and set them. It would be cool if you had wireless access to the thermostat and could set the temperature using a smartphone app or tablet with a more user friendly interface. It would assuredly raise the price but I?™d be willing to pay the extra for the convenience.So I see possible improvements but I wouldn?™t keep coming back to the Lux if I didn?™t think it was a good product. I guess saying I bought three is endorsement enough.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","no",7,5

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Lux Thermostats","Tom T","9-9-2014","Pattern: 7-Day|Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )","This is a review of the Lux TX9100U 7 Day Programmable Thermostat. I am replacing the Lux TX1500E that I have had for a few years. I also have a Lux TX500 Uc that I will put into my shop, so... I will refer to each one at times.Since I already had a Lux programmable thermostat installed it was very easy to replace it with the new thermostat. I removed the old one after writing down the wire colors and where they were attached on the old thermostat. This was done just in case the new one did not work properly.I had the wires labeled previously. The new thermostat came with a sheet of labels to do this also.The new thermostat attached to the same screw holes in the wall as the old one. The size of the unit was slightly different so that a very small bit of painting touch up will be required on the wall. It attached securely and tight.Here is the first problem: the screw heads for thermostat/furnace wires, which work with either slot or phillips, are so small that I had to get my wife to locate her sewing machine tools.She had a very tiny screw driver to unscrew the thermostat wire attachment screws. There was not a screw driver in my shop that was small enough. I attached the wires, put in the batteries, and snapped the thermostat onto the mounting plate.Programming the 4 different times for the seven days went well and easily except that the copying of one day to the next had no clear directions, which I found to be problem two. This was copying the same settings from one day to the next without having to go through the whole procedure. The instructions provided with the thermostat were unclear. I decide to call Lux to find out how they were for customer service. I got a recording which said to leave my name and number and they would call back within 24 hours. This is better than being on hold for an extended period of time, but not as good as a Person. They gave out the web site and I found clearer directions there and was able to copy my daily program to another day without having to go through the four period day programming.I tested the cooling and heating and all worked fine. I should mention that it is good to shut the breaker off for the furnace before starting the removal of the old thermostat. This is not that you will get electrocuted from 24v, but rather to keep from blowing a fuse in the 24v furnace board.One thing I really liked about my old thermostat, the TX1500E was that the thermostat temperature programming procedure was printed right inside the thermostat cover, very handy. If I decide to reprogram the new one in 6 months, I will have certainly forgotten how to do it and will have to go online or search for the directions in the file cabinet. I mentioned the other Lux TX500 Thermostat... it will be installed exactly the same and just will have slightly different programming features. Either one would have been fine for my house (2 stage furnace, one stage air). The advantage to using the programmable thermostat is a real savings in heat cost since there is no forgetting to change the temperature. Overall, I have always been happy with the quality of the Lux thermostats which is why I went with them a second time.I have never had the thermostat run by the furnace power, always used batteries, and I will likely have to get a furnace guy to hook that up properly if I decide to go away from the battery use.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","no",7,4

This unit was super easy to install and program. I had it up and running in just a few minutes. I don't have air conditioning in my house but I do have central heating and we are gone for much of the day so it's nice to program the unit to come on shortly before we return from work. I also have it warm up in the mornings before work. It's worked perfectly with just one small annoyance. This may be common with modern thermostats, but if you want to override the setting and turn on the heat, you need to adjust the temperature at least 2 degrees higher or nothing will happen. In our house, it's fairly small and we have the temperature dialed in exactly where we want it but sometimes we just want it half a degree warmer. So it's a little annoying to have to turn it up 2 degrees higher and then remember to turn it down later or it will be too hot. Kind of a silly thing but other than that, this is a great unit at a good price. It looks great too. Very clean looking in our modern house.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","no",5,4
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Decent features for a budget thermostat","Gadget Geek","9-16-2014","Pattern: 5-2 Day|Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )","I've used and recommended Honeywell thermostats (usually the higher-end models) over the years.  This was my first experience with a product from Lux.  This review is for the Lux TX500U Universal 5-2 Programmable Thermostat.So you're shopping for a thermostat.  A programmable thermostat is absolutely the way to go and can save you hundreds of dollars a year in heating/cooling costs.  With a programmable thermostat, you can set it to heat/cool at certain times of day to maintain a comfortable temperature at home.  This helps as when you are typically at work, the thermostat can be set to turn off, saving you power and money.  Which one you decide to purchase should depend on your typical habits.For basic needs, there are the 5-2 programmable thermostats (5 weekday, 2 weekend) meaning that it would have certain settings for the 5-weekdays, and a different setting for the 2-day weekend.  If you have more complex schedules, there are also 5-1-1 (5 weekday, Saturday, and Sunday), or 7-day (each day has its own settings).  For more sophisticated needs, you can splurge on ones that can be programmed over wi-fi, touch screens, color screens, or the Tesla of thermostats -- the Nest.This Lux product is as basic as you can get it, for those with basic needs and on a budget.Based on my limited use so far, heres what I thought of the systemPROS:- Backlit display (press any button to have display lit up).  However, the buttons do not light up.- Programmable -- 5weekday 2weekend.  You can program 2 or 4 periods per program set.- Can be used in many different HVAC systems/configurations (except electric baseboard heat)- Smart recovery -- reach your desired temperature by a set time- Lockout features -- prevent people from fiddling with the settings- System Control Duration -- This allows you to set how frequently the system is allowed to turn ON when it is in a programmed temperature mode.  Contrast this to temperature swing settings that many other thermostats use, this could decrease the # of times the system turns on.CONS:- Not that intuitive to setup.  The basic installation guide lacked detail.- Made of flimsy plastic.  The latched panel looks like it can easily be broken off.- Many keys hidden behind the panel.- Backup battery compartment can only be accessed from the back.  Inconvenient when you need to replace it.- Buttons do not light up.While this thermostat is far from perfect, it is a decent thermostat for the price.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","no",3,3
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Easy to install.  Doing a great job of working to the program.","myotherself","9-4-2014","Pattern: 5-2 Day|Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )","From the instruction sheet:  This thermostat can be used with most 24 volt:  gas, oil, Millivolt, electric heating and cooling systems, including heat pumps with an aux/emerg heat element.  It cannot be used with:  120/240 volt heating elements (without a transformer), or on heat pumps that have two compressor stages (Y2).  Ask your dealer for other Lux thermostats to control those systems.This Lux TX500U Programmable thermostat was easy to install and also easy to program for our heating and cooling system.  We have natural gas heat and this thermostat controls the temperature in the downstairs of our home.  I went to the Lux company website and watched a video of how to install the thermostat.  I also spoke with the man who keeps my systems running and got a little advice from him, but we did not have any trouble with the installation of the unit.  The advice we got was to turn off the breakers for both of our heating/cooling units as well as to unplug them both in the attic.  This was probably more caution than we needed, but we did it anyway.One of the things I really liked about this unit right away was that I could hold it in my hand and perform all the programming after installing the two AA batteries (recommended by manufacturer to use Energizer or Duracell Alkaline ONLY).  This made it much easier to see what I was doing.  The controls on the front of the panel are 1) Heat/Off/Cool; 2) Auto/On Fan; 3) Multi-function Set slide switch; 4) Up/Down buttons; 5) Emergency button; and 6) Next button.  These are the buttons you will use when programming your unit.  There are nine configurations for this unit.  They are:  1) Clock (12 hour default or 24 hour military;  2)  Temp. scale (Farenheit or Celcius; 3) Thermostat type (programmable or manual); 4) Period quality (4P default - morn, day, eve, nite) or 2P (day and nite); 5) Early Recovery (Off default) temp values start at the exact period start time; 6) System mode (Furn default) or HP for heat pump; 7) Delay (5 default - furnace waits 5 minutes after previous run to come back on; 8) Temp Swing (set between 1-9 times of operation per hour with 3-6 most commonly used); 9) Stage-2 offset (2 default) value 0-9 will determine degrees from set point temp for system to turn on again.  These values are set once and probably will not be re-set after you find how accurate your thermostat is.  I have gone back and changed the Stage-2 offset from the default setting to #4 because this thermostat is so much more accurate than my old unit was.Once you set the day and time it is very easy to go through and set the program for Mon-Tues-Wed-Thurs-Fri, Sat, Sun with the time of day for each of the 4 possible times (morn, day, eve, nite) and the temperature for each using the up/down button with ""next"" setting the program before you move on to the next day/time/temp.  You can override the current program using the up/down buttons and the ""hold"" button.  The print and numbers are a little small on the unit, but you can tap up/down/or hold and the screen will light up long enough to see what the current program and temperature is.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","no",3,4

Observations:1. Of course, old mounting holes in the walls (I have two pairs of them) don't match with the holes in this thermostat, so I'll have to put another two hole in my poor wall.2. The pictures are deceiving: they show nice blue screen which will appear only when you start pushing buttons; in normal condition the numbers on the screen will be not so bright and visible.3. Compartment for wires coming from the wall is pretty shallow, so you'll have to apply some effort with placing them so they don't get cut off or prevent the unit from closing.4. There is no external door for the battery compartment, so every time you need to replace the batteries - you'll need to take off the front part of the unit from the wall (and then deal with the wires again - see #3).When ordering, make sure to order LUX Universal Wallplate - there is a good chance the wall behind your old thermostat was not painted.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","yes",3,4

The steam heating system stops but there is so much heat in the radiators that it gets a bit warmer. Most of the time it would not go 1Â°F over the set point, which is nice.

It was not controlling it properly, it was constantly short cycling which triggered the pellet stove to begin its cycle, then when the controller turned off 3 - 4 seconds later, the pellet stove would not immediately turn off. It wants to fill the bowl an be ready to ignite, but it would not ignite because it was no longer getting the signal from the controller. With the original version this would happen multiple times before the controller would be in a state to insist on igniting the pellets which worried me about how many pellets were in the pot. I immediately contacted LUX about this issue and they worked with me and got me the next revision which did work better... until recently.It started to flash the low battery symbol constantly. I would put new batteries in, and nothing would change. I put another set of batteries in...no change. I then checked the voltage level of the batteries and found them to be in prime condition. Once again I contacted LUX and they agreed to send out a replacement unit. That unit has now arrived and appears to be working even better than the last one. With revision b I would often hear one short cylce every once-in-a-while. I don't think I have noticed any yet.Pros:Controller now seems to be working very nicely.Customer Support was easy to work with.Easy to use.Easy to read display.Very nice to have a daily programmable controller instead of manually setting the temperature every morning and evening.Cons:It took a while the first time to convince LUX that there was an issue.Not good having a battery powered unit fail after 2 years. Fortunately it has a 3 year warranty.Customer support this second time was not good at replying to email messages. (phone conversations were the only way I got any information out of them).

His two systems were single stage heating and cooling with a standard 4 wire thermostat line. After two months of use the thermostats failed to maintained a set temperature. The hold button would not operate and would revert to different temperatures and would require resetting almost constantly. I finally ordered a two decent Honeywell thermostats and replaced the defective LUX ones. I am unsure of how these thermostats rate the many positive reviews on amazon. The thermostats also lack an auto changeover from heating to cooling when outside temperatures vary as they do in Texas. The thermostats claim a three year warranty and state that during this period you are required to return them to the retailer. Amazon does not accept returns after a short period of time and you must deal with LUX Products by email or by phone on their website for warranty. In closing, it would be best to purchase a thermostat at a retailer like Home Depot that can credit or exchange the defective products during the warranty period even if you have to pay a little bit more for them.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","yes",3,1

I waited the 24 hrs but this is modern support today.After installing it the display would keep turning off. After removing with batteries in it it would turn back on. found they put the reset button above the wires. The wires were pressing and holding the reset button. Push the wires flat and it worked.The temperature degree delay works nicely. The blue color only comes on when you touch it. Disappointed with that also. Hopefully it will work a few years. If it breaks do not count on support.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","yes",3,1
"5.0 out of 5 stars","So Much Nicer Than Old Analog Thermostat","SevereWX","10-12-2014","Pattern: 7-Day|Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )","I was skeptical of this thermostat after having read various negative reviews from several different websites. My reservations seem to have been unfounded, however. The thermostat comes with a helpful instruction sheet that shows how to wire it up from various types of heat and a/c units. Having an older American Standard system with several extra wires (which were unnecessary for an electronic thermostat) did make wiring this unit up a little more confusing than the majority of installations would likely be. Still, within 20 minutes I had everything up and running just fine. I was able to use the per-existing mounting holes from the old analog thermostat, which saved me a lot of hassle in having to drill new holes.The menu system is easy to use, and it is important to note during installation whether you have gas heat or heat pump. The thermostat defaults to gas, so if you have a heat pump, make sure to select the correct setting in the menu system before turning it on, or you'll have no heat.The swing setting adjustable, and is set too tight for my tastes. I do not like my air conditioning unit kicking on upwards of 6 times per hour just to maintain a perfect temperature at all times. Loosening the setting up to allow for a 1.5 degree swing in either direction still allowed me to maintain a comfortable house at all times, yet only has the air conditioner have to cycle twice per hour, hopefully prolonging it's lifespan since the on/off cycles cause the most wear and tear.The temperature settings can be adjusted for 4-different settings per each day of the week, 2-different settings per each day of the week, or a simple single temperature at all times. The flexibility this programming allows is great for just about any situation anyone would have need for.The display is easy to read, the temporary lighted display makes reading the thermostat in the dark a breeze, and the outer plate that covers most of the buttons and switches makes for a very clean and stylish installation.Needless to say I am very happy with this thermostat, it functions perfectly fine with my American Standard 'Heritage' system.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","no",7,5
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Excellent full feature thermostat but you must download the PDF manual first.","jack wilinsky","8-28-2014","Pattern: 7-Day|Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )","First of all, the three most important aspects to this(assuming you opened the package without bleeding to death) are the installation, prgramming and setting, and the features. We should start with the instructions. Enclosed we find an instruction sheet in English and one in Spanish. At the end of the instructions, we are told that these instructions are not complete and we should download the full instructions from their website. It would have been nice if they told us that at the beginning before we tried to figure out the strange references to switches that are not visible. It would also be nice if they actually enclosed a paper copy of the full instructions since it isn't much bigger than the short version. Once you get the PDF instruction manual things start to make much more sense. Actually, everything is explained well with just one oversight: there is no explanation how to open the front panel nor how to remove the back plate. OK, it isn't all that hard to figure out but when I have to exert considerable force(which you do, especially when it is new) I start to wonder if I am doing it correctly. So, to open the front panel(they show it open in the PDF) you pry it open from the top using the edge closest to you, otherwise you will remove the front assembly from the back plate. To remove the back plate, exert even force around the top and bottom, engaging the rear portion only. Since it takes a bit of force, be careful not to fumble with it once it all of a sudden comes apart, since there are connection pins(be careful not to bang into them and bend them; they are sturdy pins, though)and circuit components that could be damaged if you bang into them. The screws are inside after you remove the back plate(they don't tell you that ahead of time). Everything else is just fine and this is really easy to install and use. For example, one of the more difficult installations is to figure out how to install the simplest of cases: a two wire system, found in older homes! Often this simple case is overlooked and you could go crazy trying to figure out how to simplify the process down to just two wires. The instructions specifically tells you how to do it(use RH and W1, actually just W). So, you can program your heart out with this or just do a simple setup. Just be sure to download the PDF manual FIRST and follow it carefully and you should enjoy this thermostat. By the way, I don't see any type of ""A"" and ""B"" point settings, which would determine separate on and off temperature values. There is a paper included that explains(with confusing reference to obsolete models; this one is the newer model) it does this automatically. It monitors the on/off behavior for a few hours and determines the optimum on and off values for a given temperature setting, so it takes a few hours for this to settle into an optimum behavior. But there is a setting for ""swing"", which tells the device how tightly you want the on off temperatures to stick to the temperature setting. That will determine how frequently the heat(or cooling) goes on and off per hour.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","no",7,5
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Good control, without being complicated","Water Monkey","9-12-2014","Pattern: 5-2 Day|Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )","We replaced our old Lux thermostat (approx 10 yeears old with this one TX500U).  Our other unit was also a 5-2 unit.  If you are trying to decide between a 5-2, 5-1-1, or 7 day thermostat the basic question you need to ask yourself is, ""How much programming do I want to have to do"". 7 day units allow for the most control as each day is its own customizable program.  This works great if you have specific days in the week that vary widely in how you want to heat/cool your home.  The 5-2 unit is the most basic pattern as it gives you 2 programs M-F and Sat-Sun (the 5-1-1 unit treats Sat and Sun as separate programs and M-F as one). The price difference is only a few dollars, so I suggest getting the one that fits your lifestyle. Once you have decided on the type of thermostat, it's time to install.We were replacing an older unit so installation was simple; just mark which terminals each wire in the old system was going to, remove the old unit (including backing) and mount the new unit. I had no issues changing the unit, as they are all pretty similar.The Lux systems come with predefined periods of the day.  These are basically the number of times a day you can re-set the temp.  You have a choice between 2 or 4 periods.  We choose 4 periods to give us more flexibility.  The unit comes with factory defined times for those periods, but you can set them differently if needed. At this point you just set the temp for each time period for both weekdays and weekends.There are many nice features in the unit that most of us will leave at the factory defaults (delay, early recovery, swing...). You can look into them and decide if you want them changed.I am pleased with my unit.  It provides sufficient amount of control for us.  Initially I wanted to go with a 7 day controller, but scaled back once I realized our day-to-day schedule does not change much. I can see using this thermostat until I finally move to a smart thermostat","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","no",3,4
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Spend $20 More to Get Away from this Low End Unit","Quality Man","9-1-2014","Pattern: 7-Day|Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )","This review is for TX9100U (7-Day).  Note there are three different Lux models associated with this page: TX1500U, TX500U, and the TX9100U which can cause some confusion in the reviews here.I installed this on a rental property I own as the previous thermostat (different company) was getting old.  I do have a little experience with Lux as I have a unit in my own home that is about eight years old.Installation started good as there are helpful stickers to put on wires as you uninstalled the old unit.  The diagram showing popular wire configurations made it real easy for me.  For my setup, I was working with a heat pump.  I thought I was stuck for a moment but then I realized that a bridging wire was in the little plastic bag to bridge Y to W.  After I got the wires setup, I put the batteries in and popped the cover on.  Next I switched the power back on, and everything worked perfectly.Next was configuration and setup.  To my surprise, there is no diagram in the manual about the front panel!  The manual uses all text for describing this, and this greatly slowed the configuration stage.  The manual also calls the Temperature control area the ""System Mode"" switch.  I'd recommend the manual and the front panel labeling use consistent terminology.  After these little hiccups, I was able to get the unit setup as desired.This unit clearly feels like a budget thermostat.  The cover feels cheap and can be amazingly difficult to open.  How difficult?  I bent a finger nail trying to get the thing open -- and I have very short nails.  The secret is to push up under the panel while you try to open it.  My older Lux is much easier to use and operate compared to this guy although this display is much bigger.  One issue I notices with the display is that the AM/PM indicator is on the very edge of the screen making it hard to read.Overall, there are a lot of little things that add up to drop this score down to three stars.  Although I enjoy Lux products, my advice is that you chip in the $20-$50 so that you can get out of the low end budget model.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","no",7,3

Will be replacing with another brand.","Eagle Eyes","9-6-2014","Pattern: 7-Day|Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )","UPDATE:  So, after using this for quite some time I have decided to update the review.  The thermostat does not seem to have the DST feature built in.  I accidentally noticed the time was off by 1 hour.  I was fully expecting the thermostat to auto adjust DST.  Additionally, the front flip cover that provides access to most controls is way too ""sticky"".  On a couple of occasions I pulled the thermostat off the backplate trying to open the cover to get access to Cool - Heat slider.  I removed the cover completely but now it does not look as neat - a feature I liked about it.  I am thinking of replacing this thermostat with a touch-screen Honeywell or Emerson Sensi soon.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  TX9100U was easy to install and program.  I took a picture of the old RiteTemp thermostat's connections before disconnecting it, so I knew which wire was which.  I also labeled each wire with included stickers.  LUX looks more elegant on the wall than the old bulky RiteTemp it replaced.  You may consider getting a backplate because the wall faded less under the old thermostat than it did around it.  fading was not that noticeable on a light beige wall, but maybe more noticeable with other colors.  Programming was easy and almost completely intuitive.I used the thermostat for some time and clicking is annoying.  There are a few clicks per cycle and they are quite audible.  The thermostat is in the living room and clicks can be heard over the TV noise.  Old RiteTemp thermostat had only two clicks - one for on and another for off.  I also do not like that Cool flashes on the screen while AC is running, but that is not a big deal.I neither love nor hate this thermostat.  It is probably a good value for the price, but I may end up replacing LUX TX9100U with something that is less noisy.  I think Honeywell has thermostats figured out.  I have Honeywell RTH7600D, and I like it.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","no",7,2

If I don't close the door just right, it gets stuck open and feels like it'll break. The manual is a sheet of paper (full manual online). It looks cheap on the wall.That being said. This is a really good thermostat functionally.There is an insert that says if I have ""a"" or ""b"" in the suffix, then this is a newer model that has ""Heat/Cool Cycle Duration"" setting.Well the one I have has ""c"" in the suffix.Ugh so they didn't update the insert after updating the model.And after a bit of confusion trying to find the ""Heat/Cool Cycle Duration"" setting in the same insert, I realized it's the ""Temperature swing"" setting in the manual.Ugh. Call it the same thing in all the papers. I'm already nervous about installing it wrong...The idea is great, you can have the system come on more often (as opposed to less often and runs longer). This is great if you want to keep the temperature more consistent in rooms that the thermostat isn't in. Basically adjust how far off the desired temperature you want to allow it to be.

Lux Products TX500U is all that. It claims to work with almost any system, and I can confirm that it at least works with a cobbled-together, 80 year old wiring, pain in the butt, HVAC system. It also claims that it takes 15 minutes to install, and it took me (with my very limited knowledge) 12 minutes.For an affordable thermostat, this thing is loaded.Multiple settings (4 settings per day, separate weekday and weekend setting), easy to read, filter monitor, out of the home energy savings, installs with just a screwdriver and has a nice, clean look on the wall. It als comes with multiple installation options so you can adjust it to fit your own home.There are drawbacks, of course. The control buttons don't light up, just the display face, so it is a little hard to mess around with at night.

I have a heat pump and was assuming this was covered. The instructions mentioned nothing to the contrary so away I went. What I didn't realize until winter when our new tenants asked about the MASSIVE electric bill and an HVAC tech sent a picture of the missing dip switch (as noted in the manual I downloaded for this model) that it was a TX1500U*c* and not heat pump compatible. They were running on electric heat the entire time. Awesome.The one I ordered was clearly a TX1500U and clearly stated HP compatible so basically, I received the wrong product. It looks like Amazon simply sent me the wrong one somehow. The thermostat worked well for what it is with air conditioning and electric heat but was not what was ordered. I hate to slam the unit itself but something is wrong with the supply chain. Were they boxed up wrong in the case that Amazon pulled from? Did Amazon simply stock them improperly or pull the wrong one? I don't know.

I've swapped out light switches with dimmers, crummy low-flow shower heads with nice big ones that have much better water pressure, etc.  I plan on taking it all with me when I leave - it's easy to swap out stuff like that.  Hence my desire to replace that god-awful 1980s thermostat with something like this - a digital, programmable modern-day thermostat.I swapped out thermostats before.  They're about as simple as it gets.  At least for old homes - there's only two wires to worry about.  Kill the power to the unit (use a power or line tester if you have one - they're cheap and come in handy) and stick the wires in the correct holes.The instructions were a little wordy / confusing.  It includes one giant sheet that shows all these different possible configurations of wiring your home may have.  If you've never done this before, it may be a little daunting.  But I managed to figure it out without destroying my apartment, so you probably will too!This unit has some neat functions to it, but they're not exactly intuitive.  Me, I don't need them;  I live alone (for now) so I just set it to the temperature I want when I walk in the door.  I turn everything off when I leave.  I told a friend recently that I do this, and they told me it may actually be cheaper to leave it on all day, rather than have the system fight to bring the temperature down at the end of the day.  So, with that said, I'll take a deeper dive into the programming features.  I like things to be simple - dead-easy to figure out and use.  This device is a little on the complex side, being that you have to hit several selections just to choose one option.  BUT - for me?  For the price?  I like it.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Setup is a bit tedious","Paul Avery","4-16-2014","Pattern: 5-2 Day","I bought this elsewhere, but Amazon is my usual place for comments.  There seem to be 2 models with almost the same model number, one with an ""a"" appended.  The one I bought is the TX500Ua.  I think the only difference between the two might be whether the programming is done with buttons or dip switches, but I haven't checked that.  Mine is programmed from the front panel with a button sequence.This looks ok so far, but the programming mode only remains for a few seconds before dropping out.  Perhaps the programming mode sucks up huge amounts of power, and that would explain such a design.  Probably not though.  I finally wrote down ahead of time all of the selections I wanted so that I did not have to read the instructions while making the settings.It's also packaged in one of those annoying unopenable clamshell packages, though I did manage to open it.  :-PAdditional comments:  After my grousing here, I got the thermostat installed OK, though I did select the wrong wiring diagram at first (one that assumed a common 24 volt transformer rather than the two separate ones, one for heating, one for cooling, that I happened to have).The thermostat seems to work fine and seems a good deal.One of the setup items is is ""System Cycle Duration,"" something that sets the minimum length of time from the beginning of one ""on"" cycle to the next, or at least I think that's what it does.  I could not understand why one would want such a setting, as I figure a thermostat should come on when the temperature drifts away from the setpoint by some amount (which I don't believe is configurable) and then cut off when the temperature is back in range.  Whatever the time between one off-to-on transition and the next needed to maintain the temperature seemed irrelevant.  Adding to the confusion is that the programmed value is described in terms of ""times per hour,"" which it is not.  I did not find anything on the Lux website explaining this setting but only a description of the setting itself.  I believe it defaulted to something like ""20,"" meaning I believe a minimum time of 20 minutes between the start of one ""on"" cycle and the next, never mind what the temperature might be.  After some internet searching, all I could come up with was that this would allow someone with perhaps an improperly sized system inclined towards ""short cycling"" to extend the time from one on cycle to the next.  I still find it a bit confusing, but it might be handy in some circumstances.  This cycle duration setting is available for both the heating and cooling sides, as well as an ""emergency"" cycling setting that seems useful only for a heat pump's secondary heating arrangement.There is also a ""Delay Time"" setting that I assume or hope overrides the ""System Cycle Duration"" setting, but I could not tell whether that was the case.  The ""Delay Time"" setting is important to prevent cycling a compressor (a/c or heat pump) back on before the compressor's discharge and intake sides have more or less equalized so that it does not attempt to start against a high head pressure.  I would think the 5 min default value for ""Delay Time"" is best left unchanged.With these things in mind, I think I will change my ""System Cycle Duration"" to some value like 10 (a minimum of ten minutes between each on state) on both the heating and cooling side and see how that works.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","no",3,5

The time it takes to program (once you figure out how, as the printed instruction is vague) is appx 15-20 minutes. I ordered 6 of these and programmed them for my church, so I got the hang of it after the first one and was able to go through these as fast as it could possibly be done.  Problem is, there's no fast way to do it.Each day has 4 time settings in which you can change the time you'd want the temperature to change. So from Monday morning to get all the way through the week to get back to Monday morning, you will have to click ""Next"" 8 times to get through each day x 7 days, so to get back to Monday = 56 times. That's a lot of clicking = time consuming.  So if I forget to change the time for Wednesday night I want the Air or heat to come on, I have to click ""Next"" 55 more times to get back to where I need to change the time. If there were a ""Previous"" button, I click it once and I'm there.

Unfortunately one key item that the thermostats do not allow you to control is the swing setting.  This would be fine if the swing setting default was programmed correctly; however, the a/c will randomly come on when the room temperature is below the set point and other instances where the a/c will not come on even when I manually put the set point several degrees below the current room temperature.Everything else seems to be great (like the look, size of the display, control mentioned above, etc.), but due to this key outage, I cannot recommend the product and will be looking for two new thermostats.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","yes",7,1

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Full functioned, but cheaply built with awkward interface","Karl","9-11-2014","Pattern: 7-Day|Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )","You get what you pay for.  I have two Honeywell programmable thermostats that I purchased from Amazon a few years ago  -Â Honeywell  RTH7600D Touchscreen 7-Day Programmable Thermostat.  The instructions for installation and usage for the Honeywell are crystal clear and well-illustrated, programming with the touchscreen (and no physical buttons and sliders like this Lux) is extremely easy and the shell has a solid feel to it.In contrast, this Lux thermostat's plastic shell and buttons feel cheap;  you have to flip the front open and manipulate sliders and hold various buttons down - 2 seconds in one case, 5 seconds in another - to switch into modes that let you program.  The installation instructions are a bit of a joke - so many steps are omitted and so few are illustrated.  For example, the obvious step of detaching the back plate for installation is not mentioned, and it wasn't completely obvious how to do it without trial and error.  After wiring the back plate, they never tell you to push the thermostat onto it.  Not worth detailing every step that had errors or was omitted, but it wouldn't matter too much for someone who has installed a thermostat before - but for someone for whom this is their first, I just cannot recommend the Lux in comparison with the crystal clear and lavishly illustrated Honeywell installation manual - down to Honeywell's caution to properly dispose of the toxic mercury switch in old thermostats.  The PDF manuals for these and most products are online, so I recommend that buyers review them before purchasing to get a full feel for installation and operation.The display on the screen does not look like the photo with this product listing, so they must have changed the software.  The room temperature number is smaller, and there is a permanent battery level display to the right of it in the shape of a battery with a %-sign next to it.  Because my batteries are new (not included), it looks almost like a large black ""1"" to the right of the room temperature.  Ugly, confusing and unnecessary.Granted, this Lux TX9100Uc is half the price of the Honeywell - and for that I can excuse the cheap plastic, but not the poor instructions and software (firmware).  If you're in a cool-only and/or heat-only climate and on a tight budget, I'm sure you'll find this fine.  If you're in an area that needs heat in the morning and air conditioning in the afternoon, you'll want to look at the Honeywell or other thermostats that can handle multiple modes automatically per day, as this Lux can only be in heat or cool mode based on a a slider switch behind the hinged front panel.UPDATE 11/2/14:  This TX9100Uc is not ""daylight savings time"" aware.  My old Honeywells, mentioned above, automatically set themselves back an hour last night, but not this Lux.  I see now that it isn't mentioned as a product feature, although another Lux product has it.  Another reason for me to not particularly recommend this thermostat.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","no",7,3

For the money, this is an excellent feature set, and it appears to be built as well as the older Lux models I've used with great reliability.Installation was easy, using the typical screw placement and housing shape.  Build quality is good.  It doesn't have the feel of more expensive brands, such as White Rodgers, but it's still a good product.  In this model, you can skip the AA battery if you have a 24v common wire.  If you don't, the battery should last over a year.The screen is very easy to read with a nice large temp display I can see from across the room.  Programming is dead easy to do, and you can program each day.  My last lux had a temperature range setting so that your home could be in a wider range of temps if you wanted to save on equipment wear and tear (it would cool it down to a few degrees below the setting and let it get to a few degrees above the setting before starting the equipment).  This model instead lets you change the time between these cycles.  In effect it's not that much different and it lets you directly control this aspect instead of taking a roundabout approach.  There's the typical filter replacement indicator, which is a great idea.  Finally, you can set this model up to have your home cool by the appointed time (it starts early based on how long it takes to cool your home).In other words, it's quite a feature set for the price of a barebones thermostat.  Basically a no-brainer if you're trying to save money.  I have noticed that these programmable thermostats make a real dent in the power bill, so given the value conscious goal of these products, it's nice to see a model that is a great value in and of itself.","Lux_TX500U","2018-01-31","no",7,5

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Good Value, Poor Documentation","GLS","1-19-2017","Package Quantity: 1|Verified Purchase","I replaced an old Honeywell mechanical thermostat with this Honeywell RTH221B1021/A 1 Week Programmable Thermostat. (I mention the exact model here because these reviews appear to include reviews for various other models, a practice I feel defeats the purpose of a review). The thermostat seems to be well enough constructed and functions as advertised, that is, is programmable for a single day in four selectable time periods and that day is replicated identically for each day of the 7 day week, or each day of the 365 day year, if you like. I agree with some who take exception to the description ""1 week programmable"". It should read ""daily programmable"",  but for a retired person like me, it's perfect. The controls are very intuitive and ingenious in their simplicity. Set it and forget it, unless you want to alter the temperature for an indefinite time period, then just adjust the temperature on the display to the desired target temperature and press the ""hold"" button. To revert to the original program, simply press the ""run"" button. This review would have earned five stars had the thermostat come with any wiring instructions whatsoever. The adequate operating manual talks about programming only. I believe the only other instructions said to hook it up according to the color codes used for your previous thermostat, which is ludicrous. Mine is a two wire heat only system and there was nothing I could do but surf the internet for wiring color code conventions and verify I had the right connection terminals with an Ohm meter. Not a big inconvenience given the low price, but still, shame on you Honeywell!","Honeywell_RTH221B1021","2018-01-31","yes",NA,4

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Honeywell RTH221B1021/A Thermostat","Chuqeaux is an Amazon Customer","10-13-2014","Package Quantity: 1|Verified Purchase","Okay, stay with me until the end...I had two A/C units (and two separate blowers) with the old ""dial-type"" thermostats.  They worked but were hard to adjust precisely.  Thus, I purchased two of these for a DIY installation.I had already checked the wires coming into the old thermostats and determined that it was the standard 4-wire setup that I was expecting.  However, when I installed the new thermostat, it didn't work correctly.  The outside A/C compressor unit would kick on and I would feel the cooler air, AND, the compressor would kick off when the correct temperature was reached.  HOWEVER, the blower would always run.Since the old ""dial-style"" thermostat worked correctly, I assumed the new thermostat was at fault.  I then installed the second NEW thermostat and found both had the same condition - the blower ran continuously.  I garnered up my fortitude and tried to install one of the new thermostats on my second A/C.  On this second unit, it worked perfectly meaning that my first A/C and/or blower had an issue.  I ended up calling a HVAC guy to come out.  He found a blower relay that was not working.  We were not sure why the old ""dial-type"" thermostat had ever worked.The bottom line is that, after programming this thermostat, I've not had to touch it again.  It works and works great.My wife says this experience should have taught me about assume.  Ass-u-me can make an ass out of u and me.","Honeywell_RTH221B1021","2018-01-31","yes",NA,5

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Very poor temperature regulation.","A. Carey","2-27-2015","Package Quantity: 1|Verified Purchase","This item was easy to install, and its programming protocol is fairly easy to follow (but not streamlined).I have two issues with this thermostat (one that is probably more about me, and one that is clearly a product issue):(1) I thought a 1 week programmable thermostat would give me the option to program different temps for different days of the week.  This is more accurately a thermostat that can be programmed for a one-day schedule that repeats indefinitely.  Perhaps, I'm just not sharp enough to understand thermostat designations.(2) This thermostat does not well-regulate temperatures,  I suspect that the thermometer portion of the thermostat is not functioning properly.  For example, my thermostat is set to allow the temp to cool to 65 degrees at night, but when I came in this morning (about 2.5 hours after the temp was supposed to warm to 72), the thermometer read 55 degrees.  Within an hour, it read 66 degrees, and then 75 degrees--again the thermostat was then set to 72.  This type of regularity has been persistent.  Unfortunately, my return window with Amazon has just closed, so I will dispose of this when my replacement arrives.","Honeywell_RTH221B1021","2018-01-31","yes",NA,2

You cannot set a time for each day.... meaning, I would prefer to keep the temperature a little cooler on the weekends while I sleep in but you can not set a daily different temperature. I still love it and will keep it. I just have to make sure that before I go to bed on a day that I can sleep in, I have to set the temperature to what I want and then push ""hold"". If that doesn't bother you, then I would totally get this.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Great Basic Programmable Thermostat for those who have the same schedule every day of the week","TechGuy","6-30-2014","Package Quantity: 1","This is a 1 week thermostat meaning that programming it will set every day of the week the same, Su, Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fi, and Sa will all be the same.  This is different than a 7-Day thermostat which allows you to program each day of the week differently.  A 5-2 Day thermostat allows you to program the five week days all the same and the two weekend days differently than the weekdays but the same as each other.  The 5-2 would be good for someone who works the five ?œweekdays??and is home on the weekend.  There is also a 5-1-1 Day thermostat that allows you to program the 5 weekdays the same but Saturday differently and Sunday differently than the weekdays and differently than Saturday.This thermostat, the Honeywell RTH221B, is a ?? Week??thermostat.  It will work to control heating AND cooling systems EXCEPT electric baseboard heat, heat pump system WITH backup heat, and multi-stage heating/cooling.  We have a two zone heat pump system without backup heat.  Zone 1 includes rooms where we spend most of the day.  Zone 2 includes areas of the house where we sleep.  I put this thermostat in zone 2 because we like it cooler at night but don?™t want to keep it cool all day in the summer.  While researching this thermostat I discovered that we don?™t need special thermostats for zone systems which have a zone control box.  In our case it is a Carrier Weather Maker Two Zone box which is located in the garage.This thermostat has an internal manual switch which is set to either ?œGAS OR OIL??or ?œELECTRIC OR HEAT PUMP??  It is a one time setting based on your system.  It has two external manual switches. One controls Heat-Off-Cool while the other is used to set Fan-On or Fan-Auto.  The operation of the first one is logical.  The second one, Fan, let?™s you have the fan run all the time or have it come on automatically only when the system is heating or cooling.I diverged form the programming directions by pre-programming BEFORE I installed the thermostat.  This allowed me to sit comfortably in a well lighted location and to run through the programming several times without having it connected to the wiring.  I highly recommend this especially if the thermostat will be located someplace with low light which would make it difficult to see the small lettering. There is no backlighting with this thermometer.To pre-program you will need to first install two AAA batteries (not included).Once that is done the time will appear but it will likely be wrong so you?™ll need to fix that and also set the four times you want the temperature settings to change each day.  You will have to do this twice, once for heating and once for cooling.  Here is the step by step procedure (I do cooling first but you could start with heating if you prefer as it is the same procedure):  This is for the RTH221 only.1 -  Set the left switch at the bottom to ?œcool??and the Fan switch to ?œAuto?? ??Press the ?œSet??button and the time display will flash3 ??Use the up arrow or down arrow to change the time to the correct present time including the AM and PM settings.  If you pass the correct time use the other arrow to go back.4 ??Press the ?œSet??button and the present time will be set.5 ??Press ?œSet??again and the time will start flashing again but this not to set the present time.  The word ?œWake??will appear below the time.  ?œWake??is the name of the first time period you want to set the temperature for.  If you get up at 7:00 AM you will want the set the ?œWake??time a little earlier than that so that the temperature will have time to adjust before you get up.  For example, you may want to set the ?œWake??time to 6:30 AM (using the up and down arrows) to give your system a little time to adjust to the desired temperature.6 ??Press ?œSet??  This will set the time. The temperature will start flashing.  Using the up and down arrows change the temperature to change the temperature to the desired ?œWake??temperature.7 ??Press ?œSet??  This will set the ?œWake??temperature and move you to the second time period which is ?œLeave??  The word ?œLeave??will appear below the time.  Set the ?œLeave??time (as you did before with up and down arrows) to set the start time of the ?œLeave??period (the time from when you leave the house until you get back).8 ??Press ?œSet??again.  The ?œLeave??time will be set and the temperature will start flashing.  Adjust the temperature you want it to be while you are away.9 ??Press ?œSet??to lock in the ?œLeave??period temperature.10 ??Follow the same procedure for the next two time periods: ?œReturn??and ?œSleep??2 ??After you set the ?œSleep??time and press ?œSet??you are finished with the ?œCool??settings.13 ??Press the ?œRun??and you are ready to start the ?œHeat??settings but before you do that I recommend that you run through the ?œCool??settings again to make sure all your settings are correct.  Just start with step 1 above and make sure everything is set where you want. Pay special attention to the AM and PM settings.  (I messed up one of these and it caused big problems.)14 ??If you find a mistake, now is the time to fix it using the up and down arrows.15 ??When you get through the whole cycle again and you are sure everything is OK, press ?œRun??16 ??Slide the ?œHeat-Off-Cool??switch to ?œHeat??  You should now be familiar enough with the process to zip through the settings but if not just start at step 2.17 ??When finished I recommend doing a review as before.18 ??Turn the ?œHeat-Off-Cool??switch to ?œOff??and you are now ready to follow the included directions connect the wiring.Once everything is connected move the ?œHeat-Off-Cool??switch to the desired position.  There is a five minute delay to protect the system in the event someone switches back and forth between settings too quickly so don?™t be alarmed if your system doesn?™t turn on immediately.There are other options such as temporarily overriding programmed settings but the Operating Manual does a job explaining those features so I won?™t go into that here.This is a low end programmable thermostat but it does a nice job and will pay for itself in energy savings in a very short time.  The display does not have back-lighting and some of the display numbers and letters are very small and hard to see especially in low light.  Nonetheless this is a good thermometer that will significantly reduce your energy bills if programmed properly.","Honeywell_RTH221B1021","2018-01-31","no",NA,5

It was simple enough to replace. The twin wiring was identical and so were the wall mounting hole centers. The directions for set-up were fairly clear. My one beef is that the new thermostat lacks back lighting which the old one had. The letters are small enough where one needs a flashlight during setup, requiring three hands at times, and is awkward for those  of us with just two hands. Omitting the back light is inexcusable since the 5/2 twin RTH2300 DOES have back lighting. Another caution is that you need a tiny screwdriver to turn the wire set screws.

Experts ""well, you need to check the circuits, run this test, that test..."" Me - dudes, I think the problem here is that the cheap thermostat has actually DIED.  Change the thermostat. So they did, but they replace it with another one of these. Which fixed the problem but I'm having it replaced because I'm not dealing with the fidgety program.NOT EASY TO PROGRAM - as I stand on tiptoe and stare at the tiny display that I have to press in exactly the right sequence to program WAKE LEAVE RETURN SLEEP.... yeah, you can't skip any of those. Which wouldn't be bad if you could READ the display and if they programming buttons weren't something from 1980. And it doesn't tell you what temp it's programmed for at any time. Just what the temp is. They put a new one in yesterday. I manually put the temp at 76 for bedtime because it was late. Woke up this morning and was fine. They noticed it was up to 80. The display on this doesn't say WHAT it's programmed to be at. Apparently installed it was programmed above 80 for daytime run. The manual override is temporary so you MUST go through all the programming steps to prevent set it.Spend a few more bucks and get something that works.

It was a nightmare to program and it didn't always respond to touch.  I dealt with it, because it was pretty.  It died this spring and I was determined to just get something that worked this time.  I've had this for a few weeks, and setting it up was a breeze.  Getting it off/on the wall to install the batteries, sooo easy.  It's not the most technologically advanced thermostat, but it does the job and doesn't make me crazy with simple maintenance.","Honeywell_RTH221B1021","2018-01-31","yes",NA,5

The setting applies to the entire week.","Amazon user","12-4-2015","Package Quantity: 1|Verified Purchase","The setting you input will remain in effect all 7 days of the week. This wasn't very clear to me, and apparently if you want a thermostat that will adjust on the weekends, it needs to be a ""7-day"" or a ""5-2 day"" thermostat. Install was easy, going from an old analog mercury thermostat to this one. The ""green"" wire was actually blue, and ""red"" was a very faded pink, but my old thermostat's circuit had the appropriate letters on it, making identification easier. I took pictures of the dismantle each step of the way to help me backtrack if needed. As a thermostat, it functions well. However, the description, and even the packaging, confused me into believing it was a 7-day device.Update: increased rating to 5 starts (from my original 3). The thermostat works well and overriding the program on weekends is as easy as adjusting the temp one time each day, so it's really not a hassle.","Honeywell_RTH221B1021","2018-01-31","yes",NA,5

As previous reviews have pointed out, no back-light and only one week programming vs week days and week ends.  This actually is fine for us since we're retired and every day is a weekend.  Issues I had with the design included it was difficult to easily separate the back and front plate, without also separating the circuit board from the back plate.  If no-one else had this issue, perhaps it was just this particular unit.  We have moved a lot, so this is one of many Honeywell digital programmable thermostats that I have installed with this issue.  The batteries also had the tendency to 'pop out'...had to clear tape them into complete installation.  That said...price and base functionality was what I was looking for, and that's exactly what I got.Ps  also like the much smaller 'footprint' this model takes up on the wall vs some other company equivalent versions.","Honeywell_RTH221B1021","2018-01-31","yes",NA,3

It was easy to install even with my very old round style type I had before this.  If you need help, just call the help line and they will walk you through it.  The lcd viewer is small and therefore so is the numbers. The one drawback I see as was with the other one, is that its hard to read at night, unless you have it mounted in a lighted area.  I just wish I had done this 20 years ago, with the digital versions.  It really did seem to make a difference in the way my furnace runs.  It does take two triple a sized battery's.  I didn't see anywhere in the manual that stated it would show on screen when to change the filters. The old one I had did do that.  Nice reminder.

We decided to do some research, and with a deal from our energy provider, we ended up with one of those $249 Nest thermostats.  I was STOKED, like a fat kid with some apple pie.  We got the Nest in, and I went to work.  Like a Dad in bad joke bookstore.  I've replaced many thermostats over the years and the Nest was a piece of cake.  BUT, we discovered it had a malfunction, so after talking with tech support, it was getting replaced.  SOOOO, back to the Honeywell.  I went out to the garage and grabbed the oldie off the shelf, and as I was walking in, my Dollar Store flip flop got caught on the door jam.  It popped the rubber thing out of the foam bottom and made me nearly fall over forwards onto the hard tiled floor.  There i was, Rambo faced, screaming in slo motion, feeling the pain of my big toe hit the metal, when all of a sudden the Honeywell touch screen goes flying out of my hands, and flips, and turns, and swings, and screams, to the floor.  BAM!!!  Cracked screen.  Out of Commission.  No Goodie No More.  Mad me.  I dropped the ball, but it wasn't the ball man, it was my $150 Honeywell touch screen I had plans to put back onto the wall when we sold the house years from now.  So there I was, at a cross roads, like Willow, but without Mad Mardigan there to take the baby.  I broke my working thermostat, and was left with TWO broken thermostats.  It was humid, then cold, then hot, then cold, then humid, the windows were open, they were closed, they were damned like Conan the Barbarian was.I decided to order THIS thermostat from Amazon.  I got in two days, and the hookup was easy.  Easy yo.  I'm talking so easy, I thought about taking it for a drink and a meal.  The thermostat works like a champ!  However I now rec'd the replacement Nest thrmostat and this one is taken down, boxed up, and awaits its new homeowner in severla years whoever and whenever that may be.Pros:1.  Easy to install (C wire is Common and NOT used)2.  Basic use makes ti fun for all ages!3.  Basic programming is available, but nothing that is 3 pointer at the buzzer wow4.

You can actually set it to come on in the morning and heat the house before you get out of bed, then you can set it for a different temp when you leave for work, and then have it kick back on again before you get home from work, and then finally low again for nighttime (if you like to save energy).

The original thermostat should have letters engraved next to where the wires are connected.  Take note of those and the color of the wire (most of the time the letter corresponds to the first letter of the color (for example, ""white"" - ""W""), however, this is not always true.After everything is disconnected, you just need to attach all of the wires to the new terminals in the Honeywell thermostat.

"2.0 out of 5 stars","No thought for replacing batteries.","Mick Hansen","12-25-2014","Package Quantity: 1","Two stars only because of the way this unit mounts.  For how hard it is to open I'd probably pull it off the wall trying to open it!!!  A bit more detail:  I live in a '70's era single-wide trailer with the wood paneling on the walls.  This unit mounts to the wall with two screws.  When you go to open it, you're not just pulling off the faceplate, you're pulling the entire guts off the wall, leaving behind a flimsy plastic baseplate.  Whoever desinged this thing put in some pin/socket connector to allow the unit to be removed without disconnecting the wires every time.  This pin connector is WAY to tight.  The last unit (cant remember the name) had the batteries behind a cover where you also had the programming instructions.  It just flipped down.  I know this one isn't programmable and maybe thats why they designed it.  One set of batteries MAY last five years or something.  But, when they do finally croak, and they will, I'll probably destroy this thing forcing me to buy yet ANOTHER thermostat.  So, instead of $2 in batteries, another $15 for a new thermostat.  Nope.I never did install it, so i honesly cannot attest to is functionality, ease of use, ect, ect.","Honeywell_RTH221B1021","2018-01-31","no",NA,2

This is just a basic thermostat that includes daily time periods that are programmable and I know many won't read it that way. Think of the price and how much you think it should do and it makes sense. Since a daytime/night time temperature change suits most, this unit will too. Although, because this has no back-lighting, you won't want it at all if you'll be needing a flashlight to see it.Install for me...could have been a breeze, but it wasn't. Trane has there own wiring and then the installer also had his own system and almost nothing was standard.Here's what I'd suggest, the Honeywell site has the manual for download. You should do that and pull yours away from the wall and do a mock install...before ordering. Yours could honestly be extremely simple or you could be without for 24 hours because of blowing an air exchanger fuse like I did.I hope that this helps someone with this online purchase.","Honeywell_RTH221B1021","2018-01-31","no",NA,4

"5.0 out of 5 stars","So Easy to install and works great !","PNYC","1-23-2014","Package Quantity: 1|Verified Purchase","I bought two thermostats that would be easy to read and set. I was afraid I would not know how to install it, as I'm not mechanically inclined - more of a bookworm. You can understand my hesitation. In any event, I received this thermostat and I installed the first one at my parents' house. They have an old mercury thermostat that was no longer working properly. Most important thing is to cut the power to the furnace, then label the wires in the old thermostat.I just finished installing the new Honeywell and it was SOOO EASY and it works like a charm. Their connections only had two wires, white and red. It couldn't have been simpler. My parents' don't want to have it set daily or weekly, just manually, adjusting the temp to fit their comfort. The numbers are clearly legible and best of all, the thermostat tells them when the furnace is on (when nothing is stated it means it's off). This saves them a trip to the basement to check if it's working - other than feeling/hearing the steam come up.The next step is replacing the thermostat at my (newer) condo. Given this practice, it should go well. In any event, there's a service number to call for help. I trust these guys can be of support, if needed. So far so good. I installed the thermostat at my condo. I thought I needed the super to cut the power to the furnace - since I don't have access to it, directly - but I didn't need to do that. My apartment is finally heated at the best temp for me. All I needed to do is reset the temperatures pre-set by honeywell on their schedule. I came home last night and the apt was a comfortable 68 degrees. It doesn't go on in the middle of the night, waking me up, b/c it's preset at 62. Anyway, I am very happy with the thermostat and can't imagine spending over $200 for ones you can control with your smartphone.There is no doubt that this product can make anyone as happy as I am.","Honeywell_RTH221B1021","2018-01-31","yes",NA,5

They could just as well have called it a ""1 Month"" or a ""1 Year Programmable Thermostat"" thermostat because there is nothing about the operation of this unit that relates specifically to a one week duration; it can only distinguish between different times of the day.  What was even more confusing was the fact that the instruction manual I received with the unit talks about setting the day of the week without any hint that some models don't support it -- and the display on this unit even has the day abbreviations etched into it (you can see them if you look at it under the right light).  Additionally, as you can see in the main product image at the top of the page, there is clearly a ""Th"" visible implying that the unit is capable of distinguishing between the days of the week.Otherwise, the unit was pretty easy to install and program and seems to work as it's supposed to.

"1.0 out of 5 stars","NEVER BUY A THERMOSTAT FROM AMAZON!","SerenaC","4-30-2015","Package Quantity: 1|Verified Purchase","This is the worst amazon experience I've ever had, both in terms of product and response.  I bought one of these thermostats because I wanted something easy to program and was under the impression that Honeywell was a reputable brand.  After a few weeks using it successfully, I bought a second for the other heat zone.  Shortly thereafter, the first one stopped working. To make a long story short, its prongs got corroded and had to be wiped off, something to consider if you live in a humid or coastal area, as this is a chronic issue.  Now, the second one has mysteriously  dropped stone dead, with no corrosion issue.  A 15 minute tech call with a hard-to-understand Honeywell rep ended with the direction to get my money back or a replacement from the vendor. Now, that would be amazon. Amazon's website says they only have a 30-day return policy, even though Honeywell's manual says this piece of junk has a one year guarantee.  After a phone conversation with amazon, they are refunding some of my money, but charging a $3.80 restocking fee, and I have to take said junk to UPS to return it to them.  Meanwhile, I'm living in northern New England and I AM FREEZING! I obviously can't wait to purchase another thermostat from amazon and have it shipped, as the heat in the second zone does not work without a thermostat, so had to get one at a local hardware store. Moral of story -- avoid this particular model, and buy your thermostats locally after reading on line reviews to learn which is right for you. If you have a problem with it, you need a refund and replacement immediately for something like this, not a week down the road.","Honeywell_RTH221B1021","2018-01-31","yes",NA,1

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Easy install and setup, but lacks some user-control of temperature cycle.","BF Hammer","11-16-2014","Size: 1 Pack","I bought this at a local Menards store with assistance of the staff. I replaced an old round Honeywell mercury-switch model. Have the typical 2-wire setup for a very ancient (40 years old?) natural gas forced hot air furnace. I decided to squeeze some savings on the gas bill by lowering the temperature during the workday when I'm never home for 9 hours, and also drop temperature overnight as I like it cooler while I sleep.Installation was a breeze. I work as an office equipment service tech, so I did not expect any trouble figuring it out, your mileage may vary in that regard though. I had the required small screwdrivers on hand. The mounting template perfectly matched the old round thermostat, so I just reused the old screws in the original holes in the wall. As I customarily do, I did read the installation and setup directions prior to installation.Programming was also fairly easy. What you have to understand here is that there are 4 adjustable times of the day where the temperature can be allowed to change. Exactly what the amount I needed for my purposes. If you wish for fewer adjustments, just set 2 or more of the consecutive time events to be the same temperature. This is how I handled the weekend program, as I only wanted to lower the temperature at bedtime and raise again in the morning. I left the ""away"" and ""home"" at the same temperature as the ""wake"" setting to accomplish that. Again, you can adjust the time of day for these events in 15 minute increments. I did not see anything confusing about this other than I would forget to push the set button and think I was adjusting the temperature, and instead was changing the time. The numbers being adjusted flash, so that was just me not being observant.The reason for me giving 3 stars is this: there is no adjustment for temperature on/off cycle. That old mercury-switch mechanical thermostat was designed to turn on the heat a couple of degrees below the set temperature, and turn off heat a couple of degrees above. That allowed the furnace to cycle on fewer times, and not waste fuel warming the heat exchanger each time. This cheap Honeywell digital thermostat turns on the furnace with only a dip of 1 degree F, off after warming to set temperature. My furnace in my 100+ year old home with little insulation started cycling on every 12 minutes for short bursts of heat. Turns out that the temperature cycle is factory set and cannot change. The only way to gain some control of this is to go into the advanced programming features and adjust the ""cycles per hour"". Default setting was 5 (maximum) cycles per hour, thus the furnace turning on every 12 minutes (5 times per hour). I dropped this setting to 3 (20 minutes wait between cycles) and may readjust to 2 in the future. Naturally, the manual does not explain the cycles-per-hour setting other than generic recommendations for different types of heating systems. I can see this becoming a potential problem with actually causing me to use more fuel than with the mechanical thermostat. I'll just have to monitor my fuel use and re-evaluate later in the winter. I may need to bite the bullet and spend 2-3 times more for a different brand thermostat that will allow me to adjust the heat cycle to something that approximates the old thermostat more closely. Wish I had researched this prior to purchase now. Cycling the furnace on-off more often can also lead to it failing, and I do not see how taking a 3-5 year loan to pay for a new furnace saves me money. Everybody I know that replaced furnaces with higher-efficient models during the 1990's are replacing their expensive furnaces again. Mine keeps chugging along.11-23-2013: I bought the Honeywell trim kit http://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-50002883001-50002883-001-Coverplate/dp/B00096JC72/ref=cm_cr-mr-titleAfter installing, I am noticing that the temperature is tracking more correctly compared to a mercury thermometer on a nearby wall. I suspect that the trim plate is isolating the theromstat from the wall surface temperature (which is cool to the touch usually). The temperature is not fluctuating so badly. Furnace is not turning on at regular intervals this weekend. It's also a lot warmer outside, so again time will tell on this.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","no",NA,3

It's an easy direct replacement for the thermostat that was built into out new house a few years ago that was damaged by the kids, The old unit used metal pins to terminate connections to the back plane.  The kids had pulled it odd and broke some pins.  I soldered the pins back on to the printed circuit board but I knew it would never be the same.  Once the batteries grew tired I decided to replace it with the Honeywell RTH2300B1012/E1.  I'm glad I did, because it works great, has excellent scheduling capability, good LCD back light, and the nature of the physical mounting should prevent pin damage from children.  A forceful downward pull should not dislodge this unit as it did with the one it replaced.  The January 2018 cold snap is a clear indicator that we shouldn't roll the dice with a cobbled unit.The temperature reading seems identical to my home's OEM thermostat.

RV's use a very different method of controlling the heater than a home heating system.  I had to use a meter to determine how to hook it up since the thermostat is clearly designed for home heating, not an RV.  It's working well for the purpose I'm using it for.One caveat for anyone thinking of doing what I did or using it in some sort of cabin normally not occupied.  There is some internal programming that is not documented in the manual and which I discovered by talking to Honeywell after I ran into a problem.  Below a certain temperature (I don't remember the number but it's near freezing) the thermostat will not turn the heat on even though it appears to be working.  You need to warm it up with your hands to a temperature above the threshold before it will start to work.Other than that little bit of a pain for my application it seems like a nice inexpensive programmable thermostat.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,4

Around a month ago, I had air conditioning installed (Carrier). The non-programmable thermostat became a bit annoying because it got too hot during the day and too cold at night, depending which direction I changed the temperature.I took a look at the old White-Rodgers thermostat and had the following connections: white to W, red to RH, a red jumper from RH to RC, blue to C, green to G, and yellow to Y. (A very good reference for what those all mean is [...]The Honeywell unit does not have an RH terminal, only an R and an RC.

Keeping my fingers crossed, but looks like the thermostat was the issue since it has been running flawlessly since the installation. Whew.Its fairly easy to program - my only gripe will be that the batteries are a little hard to replace - it uses AAA batteries, and you have to snap out the thermostat to replace them since the battery compartment is in the back of the thermostat, unlike my old one which had the batteries right in front.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,5

I haven't convinced them to push the 'HOLD' button yet (which would do the trick.)I replaced an existing thermostat with this unit. It was a very simple procedure involving only a screwdriver.

The instructions were easy to read and understand and total install time took me 30 minutes.I like that it has a five-minute delay built in before it starts up again if you try to turn the air back on immediately after it went off. This apparently helps ave your compressor which sounds good to me.Programming was easy and very similar to my old unit. You just hit the SET key as many times as you need to select the proper thing to change then use the arrow keys. Easy.You can select Mon-Fri and then Sat/Sun to set the temp for them. You can't select individual days, just ""Weekdays"" and ""Weekend"" to set a program. (I knew this going in, my old one was this way and that is fine, I just wanted to make sure the average buyer had clarity on this.The only negative I have is that the screen is very hard to see when the backlight isn't on. Even with a bright hall light I can't read it without the green backlight. You only have to push any button for it to light up (this first button press doesn't change a setting, it just ""wakes up"" the light on the screen) so it isn't a huge hassle, and I suspect that is the quality of the screen to expect on a ""budget"" unit.. Once the light is on it is very easy to read the display.Nothing fancy, but I didn't need fancy for a ~$30 thermostat.

I'll note that the wiring instructions work fine for matching up with the wires used in the CM with the exception that the low/high fan feature of the CM is not available on the Honeywell.  You will need to be sure to connect the ""high speed"" fan wire to the Honeywell for your heat and cool function.  There are ""handyman"" projects available on the internet for connecting a SPDT switch to the high and low fan wiring which then feeds the electrical current from the thermostat to the selected fan speed.  I don't need this so I didn't make the modification.  I really like the digital display, it is very readable and illuminates when you press any of the function buttons.

During installation used the default setting of 5 heating cycles per hour which is the recommended setting for this type of furnace.  After a week of consistently poor temperature control (gave it a week in case it had to ?œlearn??something in order to work properly) tried heating cycle per hour settings at the lowest (2) and highest (6), but it had no effect on the consistently poor temperature control.

Functionally it works great and is easy to program.  My complaint is the manufacturing quality.  This seems to be a widespread issue, since I've attempted to exchange the faulty unit a couple times but the problem persists on all of them.  I've also noticed other consumers with the same defect.  When the LCD backlight is on, in the lower right corner of the display you can see black smudges (almost like someone smudged their fingerprint on the inside of the display).

I use it on my gas fireplace in my man-cave because the remote was going out and this is way better. Cycles perfectly. And, I have it set to fallback to a low temperature late at night, which is a nice backup because I usually go to bed earlier and turn it down manually. So cheap and does what more expensive units do. The low cost secret is the features are behind menus instead of dedicated buttons but still it is easy to use.  Has a great feature that allows you to set the cycling property for high efficiency or low efficiency heat sources. For a gas fireplace only 10 feet away I set it to high efficiency and its perfect. You have to read instructions to learn how to use the buttons to set that up but its a one time thing. I like how the light comes on when I start using the buttons.

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Not too sure if it works with all millivolt systems","38Packard","3-1-2015","Size: 1 Pack|Verified Purchase","I purchased and installed three of these thermostats last Fall for our central oil-fired 24V heating system and they work like a charm.  I recently purchased one more for a ""three season"" room where we have a Hearthstone LP gas fire stove for heat which works off of a millivolt system.  The product literature states that this thermostat works with millivolt systems, but I cannot for the life of me get this to work reliably.  The thermostat is set to call of heat at 64 degrees but the room gets all the way down to 42 (this AM!) degrees and the stove is still not responding to the call for heat - even though the LCD reads ""Heat On"".  However, when I set the switch from Heat to Off, and then turn it back on to the Heat position, it sends the proper signal to the stove and it fires off.  This is a repeatable situation.  However, the thermostat does tell the stove when the nominal temperature has been reached as it always turns the stove off appropriately.  I've called Honeywell Customer Support (useless) and I Amazon has sent me a replacement thermostat to make sure that I did not have a defective one - but the replacement behaves in the exact same way.  Are there any heat professionals out there that might be able to tell me why this thermostat works ""manually"" but not automatically?  This is driving me crazy!!

There are four:  wake up, leave for work, get home, and go to sleep, and a separate set for the weekend.  You can change the times and temperatures for each.  We're poor young homeowners, so we can't afford to keep the house very warm.  Budgeting our will-call heating oil is crucial, since each delivery is about $850-900 and I try to stick with one a year.  Our current schedule with the programmable thermostat is 6:00 AM - 8:00 AM: 60F, 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM: 54F, 5:00 PM - 12:00 AM: 60F, 12:00 AM - 6:00 AM: 54F.  We also have an electric fireplace television stand which keeps the living room (where the thermostat is located) about 2- 3F warmer when on.  Between these two measures, I expect to save on oil and will report back on my usage at the end of the season.Highly recommended if you want a basic, cheap, programmable thermostat to replace an aging unit.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,5

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Love this thermostat!","Rusty chambers","6-12-2016","Size: 1 Pack|Verified Purchase","Best purchase I made all year and at a great price. My furnace had been acting up and the first thing my mechanically challenged wife said was ""replace the thermostat"".  I had the old round thermostat that came with the condo when it was built in 1991. If I set it for 68 degrees it would keep the furnace on till it hit 71degree and restart at 65. This kept our home either to hot or to cold. Drove me nuts with with such a large variable. The Honeywell comes on and off within 1 degree and we are much more comfortable winter and summer. By the way, the thermostat was not the problem with the furnace.I'm 67 and had no problems installing the unit. Reading the install and program instructions was another story. They just don't make instructions for the eye sight of seniors. My solution was to get the instructions on line and enlarge the print. After a little trial and error, I programmed it without any difficulties. I've changed the winter program a couple of times with no problems. For summer we just set what we want for temperature and press hold. Works great. I highly recommend it.You can pay more for extra ""bells & whistles"" but don't waste your money.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,5

When I told him that I needed to know what terminals to connect to a 2 wire 750 millivolt system he told me that it wouldn?™t work, even though the manual clearly states that it will work on a millivolt heater.

I have to say, this works a lot worse than the old one. For instance, I programmed it to always stay at 63 degrees. My furnace is constantly running ever since i switched to this one. My electric bill went up 200 dollars. It will turn off for 5 minutes, then kick back on for another 10, all day every day. It will heat my house up up to 7 degrees more than what i programmed it to do! I have no idea why it does this, and I had a professional install it for me when he repaired my heater. I'm seriously considering returning this one, but I don't have the packaging anymore because I anticipated it to work like it was advertised..... Don't buy this thermostat, invest in one that will actually run your furnace correctly.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,2

"3.0 out of 5 stars","It works, that's all the positive I can give to it.","Mark Schneider","11-5-2013","Size: 1 Pack|Verified Purchase","So far it FUNCTIONS OK. I bought this to replace the existing Honeywell programmable thermostat that was here when I bought the house, simply because that one didn't have a back-lit display, and I had to turn on the hall light to see what it was set to. That being said, I understand that this is the lowest price I could find to pay for a programmable thermostat with a backlit display on amazon, and I have to make certain concessions. But, there's two things that jump out and make me think ""WTF?!?"" in regards to this product. Number One is the huge, ugly splotch at the bottom left of the electro-luminescent back light in this unit.  I've been in electronics manufacture for over 30 years, and a defect like this would be a no-brainer -- it wouldn't get out of the QC floor, let alone out of the building onto a truck. And second, nowhere in the advertising, product packaging, or user manual does it say that the 2 AAA batteries it REQUIRES for operation aren't included. So, if you are ordering this and rightfully expecting  it to arrive complete and operational based on all advertising media on it, then you just might find yourself in a bind when it arrives and you install it, possibly disposing of your old thermostat, only to find that it's totally incapable of operating your heating system until you procure the 2 measly AAA batteries the multi-billion dollar Honeywell couldn't supply with the unit, even after saving countless millions by cutting back on its QC department.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,3

"1.0 out of 5 stars","Do not buy","Moolah","5-3-2016","Size: 1 Pack|Verified Purchase",";After struggling with the programming I finally went on line to look at the manual there. To my big surprise there were a few lines in the on-line manual that did not appear in the manual that came with the thermostat. Those few lines proved to be the only way to get the programming done. Unbelievably frustrating and time-wastingIf I hadn't installed the thermostat already I would surely have returned it","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,1

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Great Thermostat with Poor Customer Service.","glbegr","12-14-2014","Size: 1 Pack|Verified Purchase","Don't think you can get a better programmable thermostat at this price.  A little difficulty getting it programed for what I wanted which is On fifteen minutes before I get out of bed then hold the set temperature until 30 minutes after bed time.  This is set to On then OFF for when you leave I assume for work then ON when you return home then then OFF for back to work then ON for return home for the evening then OFF for bedtime.  I contacted Honeywell via Email for instructions to program it if possible for just On and Off. ( We're retired and home all day.)  Will give Honeywell ONE star (would like to give them none) due to the TOTAL lack of response.  Always wonder why they include in the instructions if you need help contact us then usually don't.  Anyway got the results I wanted by programming it ON for an hour wake up time then OFF, leaving for work for only fifteen minutes, then ON for home for lunch, OFF after fifteen minutes for back to work, ON after fifteen minutes for home from work then Off thirty minutes after going to bed.  Sounds complicated but really isn't.  Works great and very happy with the thermostat.  Wish I could say the same for Honeywell customer service.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,5

Well I apparently did not install it correctly and blew a transformer in the Air Unit.  So $250.00 later the AC guy replaced the transformer and reinstalled the old thermostat.

"1.0 out of 5 stars","Being replaced with a Lux","A. Wheeler","1-16-2014","Size: 1 Pack|Verified Purchase","This worked for approximately one month.  It then started having problems not turning on when the temperature of the room dropped to where it should have.  I recycled the electronics system per the instructions, reset everything, checked all the connections and it still continued to not function correctly.  I sent email to Honeywell technical support and got no response for 10 days.  Their ""customer support"" is in India, so that should tell you everything you need to know about the rest of the experience in trying to get them to help.  Still unresolved, so I presume that I got a lemon and I'm stuck with having purchased one that is now past when I can get a refund.  Save your money and buy a Lux.

(Two of the five zones already had electronic thermostats.)One of the three, when I opened it up to begin installation, had a bent ground pin, which I was able to fix with some needle-nose pliers. And another unit has a minor display issue in the lower right corner such that if you press the down temperature button with much force, it shows compression blackness; obviously the plastic case is pressing on the LCD panel.Otherwise the units work well, and once programmed, we don't need to mess with the settings much. Plus the price wasn't bad. Still, from what other reviewers have been saying, it sounds like Honeywell has some manufacturing quality issues they need to address.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,3

All appeared well until we woke up to a 50 degree house the next morning.  We thought something might be wrong with the furnace so he looked it over and found a fuse that was blown.  He went to the store and got a new one.  It blew again.  We had to call a licensed HVAC technician and have him come out only to discover that the thermostat doesn't work properly, therefore blowing the fuse.  That cost us almost $100 for him to diagnose and install a thermostat that actually works (because it is winter in Michigan and we need heat right now)!

One of the round ones with the mercury switch inside.  (Made by Honeywell, I might add).  Once removed, just two wires came out of the wall.  When you touch the two wires together, the furnace comes on, and when you keep them apart the furnace is off.  Couldn't be simpler.But can you imagine that this thermostat doesn't have instructions for that scenario?  I was able to Google instructions eventually, but it is ridiculous that it describes what to do if you have 5 different colored wires but not what to do if you have only two.  By the way, what you had to do was remove a jumper and attach your two wires to the CORRECT two posts, which I no longer recall.  After that the thermostat works fine, but it was unnecessarily complicated for such a simple use case.I did end up buying a second one, for the upstairs.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,3

Fairly easy to program. Recommended. Only issues was having to spackle, sand and paint the wall where the previous larger unit was and noticed it was having hard time regulating temperature. Set at 72Â°, it would quit at 74Â° near 75Â°.(too warm).and come on at 71Â°, nearer to 70Â° (too cold). Noticed in the advanced menu, there is a setting for high efficiency furnaces (90% or higher).

It works great and is still running on the original batteries.  Great thermostat for the price.  My only issue with it is that it doesn't have a way to program the cool cycle rates or the cycle on and off temperatures.  I've confirmed this with the Honeywell help technician.  I've seen a couple of posts that say the heat cycle is adjustable, but the manual doesn't give instructions for that either.  I only use this for cooling.  So, yesterday my program is set for cool to come on at 80 and it does.  The AC runs for 7 minutes and then turns off - thermostat still reading 80.  It is supposed to be +/- one degree and mine seems to be operating at a tighter range then that.  Unfortunately it is bad for the AC and not efficient to run less than 15 minutes.  Fortunately, this is less of an issue here in Arizona in July, when the system will run constantly and never move the temperature.What I do this time of year is simply operate the system manually.  I keep the program set about 2-4 degrees above what is comfortable and when I get hot I just hit the arrow button to do a temporary override of the program.  When I get comfortable I hit the run button to reinstate the programmed temperature.  I like this thermostat because it is easy to override and reinstate program.If anyone knows of a inexpensive thermostat where I can set my cooling window to +/- 3 degrees let me know.  It seems this feature is only available on thermostats that cost $100 or more.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,4

This new thermostat was smaller than the unit it was replacing. The new thermostat had more features. When I first installed this unit the old tags on the  wires fell off as I removed each wire from the old thermostat so I could not be certain which wire went into which position on the new one. Being a little flustered by losing the wire tags, I skimmed the directions and dig not pay close attention to where the wires connected with the thermostat.  I plugged the wires into the back of the unit instead of on the top of the back of the unit. The front of the unit could not be snapped into place because the wires were where the prongs were supposed to be engaged. The wires were larger in diameter than the prongs, enlarging the holes for the prongs to connect. After moving the wires where they were supposed to go and connecting the faceplate in position I could not get the system to turn on. I was not sure whether the wires were in the wrong position or if the prongs were not making contact. After several adjustments, everything started working. The unit works great and was easy to program. We have used it for both air conditioning and heating. Just take time to mark your wires with the tags provided and follow the directions for how they connect to unit as part of the installation and you will have a great programmable thermostat.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,5

Firstly, the inside clips holding the middle plastic panel to the front panel are poorly designed. They don't fasten very well. Next, the thermostat read 80+ degrees (F) for at least a half-hour after I installed it. No, the package wasn't sitting outside in the heat before I brought it in. Eventually it read the proper ambient temperature compared to some meat/brewing thermometers I had sitting around. Lastly, the LCD panel seems to have some sort of dirt or dust from the factory in the lower-right corner. None of these issues make the unit less functional, but it is a clear reminder of how little it costs.

When it recovers that 1 degree, it shuts off. I have seen my furnace go on and run for three minutes and shut off. Three minutes later, it goes on again and repeats the cycle. It does this continuously until the next set-back.My electric bill has gone up 50% due to the frequent cycling, and my gas bill went up 30%.

After reading several reviews, I concluded that this was the best choice for my needs. I have a gas furnace and electric central AC. My old thermostat was calibrated about 2 degrees too warm, and there was no way to fix it, so for $23, it was worth buying a replacement.

I like the fact that it doesn't have a hinged door that you have to open. All the buttons are always visible and easily accessible.The only reason I withheld a star in my rating is that the green LED screen has a bit of a smudgy looking flaw in the right 1/3 corner.

I noticed the issue one day when I set the temperature to 75 when it was 88 outside the A/C kicked on for two minutes and then off, but my condenser outside never shut off! Just the inside fan keeps going on for about 2 minutes and then suddenly off and on all night, all the time never getting down 75. I thought maybe I was working the A/C too hard, maybe it froze over, so I turned it off for the rest off the night and all day and turned it on the next evening, same issue. I checked the coils and everything I could think of to see what was wrong, and nothing. So I turned off the thermostat again and the a/c kicks on again even though my thermostat is in the off position! I checked all the wires and connections, nothing wrong with it, so what gives? The temps are going to be in the 100's the next few days or weeks even, so I got a new thermostat at the Home Depot, and everything is working fine!

I have read that many people said upon initial set up out of the box the unit was broken.  It is actually not broken, but has bad assembly for a good engineered product.  Assembled out of USA.  If you can put that parts back together, then remove the back.  You should be able to hot glue the sides (after installing the batteries) and the unit will hold together.  I did this and have tested successfully.  It is hard to rate this because mechanically, it works perfect, but their assembly is HORRIBLE.  Buy it, get a hot glue gun and for $20 you are ready to go.

It also takes batteries only although from what I have been told they should only need replaced annually and even then it will tell you 60 days prior to it dying that it needs changed.

I'm thinking about putting it in one of those boxes just to create sort of a buffer around it so that it doesn't kick the system on so readily.Update:I disliked that this thermostat is probably TOO accurate/sensitive/quick to react to changes in temperature as small as 1 degree, causing the AC to cycle too frequently.I opened the unit to find the temperature sensor. It isn't obvious, but when you remove the circuit board from the housing, and you're looking at the side of the board that faces outward/toward you as it is when the unit is installed, there is one dot on the board in the upper right area that is larger than all the other dots. Once you see it, you can't unsee it, and to be sure, you can flip the board around and it's a similar dot in the exact same spot on the rear of the board; it goes all the way through.That is the temp sensor. I put a small piece of duct tape over just the front side of the dot and this solves the issue. For different tape or more damping, you could tape over both sides of it, but just over the front made this thermostat perform exactly like you knew it could.Upon reassembly, the only issue you're likely to have is making sure the white plastic sliders for the bottom switches line up with the sliders they control on the board; everything pops right back together if they're lined up, and won't if they're not.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,5

Sure wifi would have been nice, but coming from what I had (100% manual adjustment with no timer), this works just as good for me. I come home and the house is cool (summer time). So Im happy.The only thing was setting up the times. I went through a period of several days to 'see what worked' for me, and if I want to adjust any of the times, I had to go through all the pages of set up again just to change one thing. Was slightly annoying, but its set now and I dont have to worry about it until the season changes.The wiring was also very easy. I just matched the wires to what I had on the old thermostat and it worked perfectly. Just make sure you shut the power off to it first.I recommend.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,4

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Cheap and basic, but fully functional.","Cerulean Dragon","6-6-2015","Size: 1 Pack|Verified Purchase","Does exactly what I needed in a thermostat. Multi-time programming, turns heat on and off when needed, cheap. Absolutely love it. Nothing irked me more (or cost me more) than leaving the heat cranked when I left the house for work. My apartment is a poorly insulated sieve to begin with, even with plastic on the windows and when it was -10-20 out it was costing me $300-$450/mo on gas heat. After my ex moved out I tried really hard to turn the heat down before I'd leave for work or go to bed, but sometimes I'd forget, so either I'd have to drag myself out of bed when I was just dozing off, or be griping to myself all day at work knowing that the heat was cranked at home for no reason.Weekday/weekend and 4 settings in a day: Wake up (turn up), leave for work (turn down), come home (up), go to bed (bed). And since I get my daughter on the weekends (and don't work) I have the weekends set differently. Perfect.Unfortunately in my case the previous thermostat was so old it had non-standard markings and I had to basically take a shot in the dark as to which wire was positive and which was negative, for the basic 2-lead configuration. Not the fault of the Honeywell though, so no stars lost for that.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,5
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Works as advertised","AzGrannie3","5-30-2014","Size: 1 Pack|Verified Purchase","I gave this 4 stars because this thermostat is a real bear to program.  It hooked up in a matter of minutes but the programming is horrible.  It really doesn't program the way the directions say it should.  You have to keep going through it again and again to finally get it to the days you want.  I need to set it so all 7 days are the same because I'm retired and use the same schedule everyday.  I finally got M-F programmed and could not get it to pull up Sat or Sun. After scrolling through each day over and over again, I finally reached Sun...yep Sun, not Sat.  So, I programmed Sun to match M-F.  Then finally Sat/Sun popped up and I could then reprogram it for the weekend.  Now, after many temper tantrums it's programmed and works great so far.The knobs underneath are quite cheap when you're moving them from Heat-Off-Cool.  They seem to be loose and don't slide very easily.  I was concerned about breaking them when I was trying to move them from Heat to Cool.  The buttons on the face of the thermostat seem to be pretty good and adjust the temp easily.  For being made by Honeywell, I expected more quality but for the price I got what I paid for.  My daughter bought one at Lowe's that did the same programming as this one and paid about $15 more for hers.  Not sure what the brand of her's was.Installation was very easy and the directions for that are very clear, especially if you already have the colored wires in your wall.  Even if you don't, it comes with labels to label each wire with it's corresponding color.  The picture guide included is very easy to read so you know exactly which position to insert each wire into.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,4

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Great thermostat that's easy to use and reliable.","TJ092561","6-29-2015","Size: 1 Pack|Verified Purchase","Purchased this Packard PTD102 timer along with Supco relay - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XS148C?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4 ...and a Honeywell thermostat - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007BHLUWM?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3I wired these into the furnace control circuit (very easy to do) so the furnace blower turns ON via the thermostat and sends the signal to this Packard timer. This timer then turns on the Supco relay that supplies 120 volts to a small window air conditioner (5,000 BTU).I have the window air conditioner in the basement near the furnace and made a sheet metal duct to direct the dry, chilled air from the air conditioner into the duct work. The furnace blower grabs the air and distributes the cool, dry air throughout the house and it is now very, very comfortable (and inexpensive) for central air - in Michigan muggy summer. Never exceeds 73 degrees, and very low humidity in the home. Sister loves it.Calculated usage puts the worst case $$ at $0.14 per hour (960 watts) for the window A/C and furnace blower fan. Even if it ran for 24 hours/day...that's just $100/month. All from a $120 window air conditioner and about another $80 in parts :)I know, I know...they say you should only cool 150 square feet of space with these little air conditioners...but this is the second time I've done this. The first one is in it's second summer in ultra-humid Spartanburg, South Carolina. I use the Haier brand without any electronic controls...just basic mechanical thermostat that is built in to it...and set it on MAX COOL - http://www.amazon.com/AMERICA-TRADING-HWF05XCL-Conditioner-5000-BTU/dp/B00BDRXN30/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1435615912&sr=8-3&keywords=haier+air+conditioner ( I buy these from another big-box for $120).The timer is set for 3 minutes and prevents the window A/C from turning ON if power is interrupted from a power outage...or turning the thermostat ON/OFF. It's very hard on an A/C compressor to cycle ON without giving time to dissipate the pressure built-up within the compressor. This little timer does the trick by preventing the A/C window unit from turning ON for 3 minutes when the thermostat turns on the furnace blower during a call for cool. Great thermostat that's easy to use and reliable.I also use this thermostat to turn on the whole-house air filtering system. I wired this thermostat to turn on a Supco relay... http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XS148C?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4 ...that turns on the furnace blower...and use a BoAir 5-stage washable, electrostatic filter with lifetime warranty to collect all the nasty stuff in the air... http://www.amazon.com/14x24x1-Boair-5-Stage-Electrostatic-Washable/dp/B001FM9UCG/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1435619396&sr=8-6&keywords=boair+electrostatic+air+filterThe thermostat is NOT being used to control heat/cool...I am using it for it's simple programming and ability to turn on during set times of the day. I use the HEAT setting and program it to turn ON twice each day...for 4 hours each period. By setting the temperature to 90-degrees, the thermostat will turn ON as it is in the basement near the furnace (where it rarely exceeds 70-degrees)...and turn ON the furnace blower to filter the home's air...and turn OFF after the 4-hour period. Simple and very effective. Whole-house air filtering and a lot less dusting and cleaning the home now.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,5

I can still decide, at some later date, to go back to the programmed mode with the simple touch of a button.  The only reason I did not give this item 5 stars, aside from the fact I have only used it for several days, is that it does not have a ""swing temp"" feature that would allow me to decide if the heater should kick on if the temperature deviates from its set point by 1,2 or even 3 degrees.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Should come with a back plate","C. Mayer","12-25-2016","Size: 1 Pack","Bought this unit yesterday and was unhappy that it fell apart in pieces when trying to get the back section off. It took several minutes to put the main board and controls back together and it now has a smudged area in the right corner when lit up. Too bad they didn't have a screw in there so it didn't come apart to change the batteries. Aside that, I still need to learn how to program it. Glad it doesn't cycle any more often that the old mercury one did. I have a furnace blower that I replaced the motor and that might not last the winter either. So, cycling likely puts more strain on it and the two utilities. I have a couple of ceramic space heaters in rooms like the bathroom and the bedroom and the cords usually don't get very warm. This cuts down on the furnace use during times it isn't as cold out. Wish these came with a back plate as they're almost about the same price as the thermostat.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","no",NA,3
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Terrific affordable universal thermostat","Snow Bird","4-21-2017","Size: 1 Pack|Verified Purchase","I bought this contrary to what Honywells tech support phone rep had to say. I needed a replacement for the thermostat in my RV (which is 12 volts D.C.), they said it would not work for that.  Being an electronics tech, I asked one more question ( ""Does it click when turning on? They said yes) that was the key, if it clicked, it has a relay, therefore it can control any low voltage, low current  load.  It also has the wireing  configuration to support two different power sources (AC & Heat).  It works great, and since its power comes from 2 aaa batteries, the voltage it is controlling has no bearing on that.  Actually that was two years ago, and working fine. My latest purchase was for a 120 volt space heater, way beyond the voltage or current capacity for the thermostat, but using it to control a solid state relay (with 5v from a discarded phone charger),  Controls the space heater within +/-  2 degrees of (scheduled) set point. No more cold bedroom, during day 55 degrees, bedtime 72, sleep time 68, wake up 72, then back to 55 for energy saving, while not in bedroom.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,5

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Great Product!","K. Kress","1-25-2016","Size: 1 Pack","Great product. Not a lot of bells and whistles like some thermostats but that is why I like it. It is basic and easy to program. While we are at work we lower the temp during the winter months and program it to kick on about 30 minutes before we are scheduled to be home to heat up the house again. On the weekends we keep it steady because we are usually home. During the summer months we program it to get hotter in the house when we are not home and have it kick in again about 30 minutes before we are scheduled to be home to cool the house. It doesnt look as ""fancy"" as some of the newer products coming out but it does a great job! Program it to to certain temps while you are away or sleeping or you can just keep the temp steady and dont have to program it if you dont want. Its up to you. No you cannot ""control"" it with your phone or tablet but then again, why would you need to? It takes a couple of AA batteries and they usually last a long time. Easy to install and if you have questions there is a number to call in the instruction booklet if you have problems. I called once as I was confused about where a couple of the wires went and customer service was very helpful....just know your type of furnace and model number first before you call because they will need that information.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Honeywell works better than the Hunter I bought the first go around","Terry","11-15-2013","Size: 1 Pack","I got this locally after the Hunter thermostat I bought was discovered to be defective.Make sure you turn off the power to your furnace before removing wires from your existing thermostat. Usually a switch off the left side of the furnace, mine it is on the top right directly under the fuse. If you don't turn the power off to the furnace you could cause damage to the furnace and will damage the thermostat.  It gives instructions in the easy install manual that comes with the thermostat.  Some I guess don't read that and lost their money having to buy another one for replacement.Had problem with the plastic screw holder, (forget their name) not wanting to fit into the hole I made for them so I just didn't use them. They aren't necessary to attach the back plate to the wall.The Honeywell's use a tiny screw to hold the wires in place where the Hunter's use a flip toggle.  I had some difficulty getting the wires into the hole in the top, they do not go in very far, just tighten the screw and gently tug on the wire. If it stays in you installed it correctly.The colors of the wires are not always correct so make sure you take note or label the wires with the included stickers before removing from the old thermostat.  In my case my Yellow wire is actually blue though the other wires were correctly colored.In the Hunters the power for the furnace is labeled RH but in the Honeywell it is R. Leave the jumper in place and put the wire into the R hole in the TOP of the connector where the jumper is. Technically you could put the wire in either one of the ports but the manual shows to put it into the R port which is what I did.Some units have a power wire, C or O coming off the furnace / compressor.  These thermostats do NOT use this as they are powered by batteries. If you try to hook that wire into the thermostat you will damage it so use electrical tape or a cap and cover it up and push it into the wall.My unit it seems there is a dark spot on the digital display, like something dirty got behind the display.  Nothing that causes any problems but it isn't a ""clean"" look when the back light is on.Mine seems to be off a few degrees from other parts of the house though there is a bit of a temperature dip in that part of the house so it is probably correct for where the thermostat is sitting on the wall. Just not on the other side of the house so I have to set the schedule a few degrees lower to get that right temperature.It uses AAA batteries instead of AA, would be nice if the industry chose a standard instead of one have one kind of battery and another a different kind.Everything seems to work though. The Hunter I bought the scheduling did not work, was ALWAYS set to Asleep mode no matter what. This Honeywell all that works well.  I had a 7 day programmable which was very annoying to have to set each day individually this thermostat you set once for week days then another round for weekends. You don't set each day individually which is what I thought this would allow. Actually glad it doesn't work that way because you have to go through ALL the settings no matter which one you wanted to check on.This does allow you to set the temperature manually and also make it a permanent temp for all time or just temporarily until the next schedule time happens. Which is nice.I mentioned this but the temp does seem to go past the temp you set it for by one degree, I guess this can be adjusted by changing the span in Advanced settings but they don't give any information about what each setting means.  It defaults at 5 but can be changed all the way down to 2.  No idea what that means for run times or temperature span, they didn't bother including that in the manuals that came with the thermostat.It's a nice thermostat, works. You shouldn't have to touch it once the settings are set to your liking, it comes preset from factory but your daily pattern may not be what the default is set to.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","no",NA,3

The biggest annoyance is when display says: ""cool on"", but it's not turning on or running at all. It can be like that 5-10 minutes. That's quite irritating on hot summer days when you're desperate for relief. The other issue is that it randomly says batteries are low, which is very confusing because I don't know if I should change them or not.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","yes",NA,3

It makes too frequent on and off. It should allow me to set the range for 'off' too. For example, I should be allowed to press the 'Hold' key and make it 'on' when it comes to 56 F, and then set to somewhere 64 F to turn it off. I will cycle on and off between 56 F and 64 F.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","no",NA,3

Super easy, just follow the instructions.  Turn off the power, mark your old wires, mount the back plate, connect your wires in the labelled spots, add batteries, connect faceplate, turn on power , and program!  The weekday and weekend programs are probably sufficient for most people who work a regular schedule.

We originally purchased this to replace the manual thermostat. It worked well for 4 months and then died. We put in brand new batteries and it still won't work. Amazon told us to contact the manufacturer, the manufacturer told us to contact Amazon. After I said that we had tried to contact Amazon first and they told us to contact them they said I had to take a bunch of pictures and then email them over and then call to verify that they received my email. I don't feel like sitting on hold for another hour jumping thru hoops and listening to crappy music that is interrupted every 5 seconds, so this is where I am stopping and saying that the $24 is a loss and we will never be buying the brand again. The customer service is from India and barely speaks English. Save your frustrations and spend a little more for a better quality product. Had I known this would be the way it would have turned out, I would have ordered a new one a week ago when my AC (in Florida) went out instead of trying to catch them when the hold wasn't over an hour or they were open.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","no",NA,1

Installing is pretty simple but requires a miniature flathead screwdriver and patience. The connections are simple and the placement of the little connection ""cartridge"" on the backside of the thermostat isn't fully diagrammed or explained. So it's kind of a mixed review- operation is 4 star but instructions and ease of installation a 3. Overall, a good value in a simple, programmable thermostat.

Ordered the 2300 unit and received the 2300, course, I always order from Amazon so I get what is advertised. Batteries need to be replaced every six months. Your sleep and wake time should be no less than 4 degrees apart, otherwise, furnace runs for 20 minutes each day, which seems like a waste of energy to me. The air conditioning settings work the same and are also very easy to program. Also has a run fan option as well, great for pushing burnt cooking smells through the air filter. Unit has a back light, making it very easy to read. I enjoy the hold button as well for over riding the programmed settings on hotter/colder days.

For one it doesn't include the ability to show how long the AC/Furnance has been running (Usage).  This is a very basic feature that should be on all digital thermostats (was included in my previous 13 yr old unit). Additionally, the way you program the unit is a bit annoying but not difficult.  If you need to adjust any program setting then you must go through the process for all programs about 12 steps as opposed to 2 or 3 steps.  This unit is just avg in terms of cost and doesn't provide any additional features that warrant a better rating.  On the plus side it only requires 2 AAA batteries.  If the unit provides the features you need then I would recommend.BTW- there support was a bit iffy called several times before I could get through (4 tries).  The automated service basically says they are busy at the moment and hangs up.  Didn't provide the opportunity to stay on hold.","Honeywell_RTH2300B1012_E1","2018-01-31","no",NA,3

When the temperature drops below its settings (which in my case is 72F) it sometimes would do nothing. The house would get increasingly colder to the point I would notice. I just came back home and the temperature was at 67F and the thermostat is still doing nothing. If I switch it from Heat to Off and then back to Heat it immediately realizes the temperature is below settings and the heat pump starts, which means something is wrong with the thermostat.
